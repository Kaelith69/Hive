5/18/24, 3:21 PM - Sayanth: The concept of Starseeds comes to us through channelers and seers who regularly connect with the Akashic records. These records comprise the energetic imprints of all intentions, thoughts, emotions, relationships, creations, and events ever to have occurred, throughout every race, in all the realms, throughout all of spacetime. While much of this information is relatively easy to channel and comprehend, there are several perspectives on how Starseeds come to Earth and the many types of Starseeds.

The AMCA is designed by the Aeronautical Development Agency (ADA), an aircraft design agency under the Ministry of Defence. It is intended to perform a multitude of missions, including air supremacy, ground strike, suppression of enemy air defenses (SEAD), and electronic warfare (EW) missions. The AMCA’s design is optimized for low radar cross section and supercruise capability1.

6/1/24, 11:02 PM - Sayanth: The Tejas Mark 2 features an elongated airframe, close-coupled canards, new sensors, and a more powerful engine.

6/23/24, 11:49 PM - Jikru: ഞാന്‍ ഇവിടെ കുറിക്കാന്‍ പോകുന്നത് എന്റെ സ്വന്തം അനുഭവങ്ങളില്‍ നിന്നുണ്ടായ കാര്യങ്ങളെ കുറിച്ച് ആണ്‌.  

1) ഞാന്‍ 2016-2021 വരെ ഇവിടെ പഠിച്ചു.  എന്റെ കുട്ടിക്കാലം ഭൂരിഭാഗം ഇവിടെ ഞാന്‍ ചിലവഴിച്ചു.  
 
ഞാൻ അനുഭവിച്ച മാനസിക പീഡനത്തിൻ്റെ അളവ് വാക്കുകളിൽ പറഞ്ഞറിയിക്കാൻ കഴിയില്ല
വിദ്യാർത്ഥികളെ കന്നുകാലികളെ പോലെയാണ് പരിഗണിച്ചത് , സ്‌പോർട്‌സ് കലകൾക്കും പാഠ്യേതര പ്രവർത്തനങ്ങൾക്കും ശരിയായ പ്രോത്സാഹനം ഉണ്ടായിരുന്നില്ല, അവർക്ക് ഫുൾ എ പ്ലസ് മാത്രമായിരുന്നു പ്രധാന ശ്രദ്ധ. ഞാന്‍ പഠിക്കുമ്പോൾ അത് ഒരു കോൺസെൻട്രേഷൻ ക്യാമ്പ് പോലെ തോന്നി, വിദ്യാർത്ഥികളെ A-Z മുതൽ വിവിധ ക്ലാസുകളായി തരംതിരിച്ചു, 9-ആം പരീക്ഷയിൽ നല്ല മാർക്ക് നേടിയ വിദ്യാർത്ഥികളെ A ക്ലാസിലും മറ്റുള്ളവരെ താഴ്ന്ന ക്ലാസുകളിലും ആക്കി. ഇത് സാധാരണമല്ല, അശാസ്ത്രീയമാണ്, ഇത് വിദ്യാർത്ഥികൾക്കിടയിൽ അപകർഷതാബോധത്തിനും ശ്രേഷ്ഠതയ്ക്കും കാരണമായി 

2) പെൺകുട്ടികളെയും ആൺകുട്ടികളെയും വെവ്വേറെ സ്പീഷിസുകളായി കണക്കാക്കുന്നു, ഒരു ആൺകുട്ടി പെൺകുട്ടിയോട് സംസാരിച്ചാൽ അവർ ഒരു ബന്ധത്തിലാണെന്ന് അധ്യാപകർ അനുമാനിക്കുകയും ഉടൻ മാതാപിതാക്കളെ ബന്ധപ്പെടുകയും അവരുടെ മകൻ/മകൾ സ്കൂളിൽ മോശം കാര്യങ്ങൾ ചെയ്യുന്നുവെന്ന് അവരോട് പറയുകയും ചെയ്തു.  പെൺകുട്ടികൾക്കും ആൺകുട്ടികൾക്കും വ്യത്യസ്ത പടികളിലൂടെ നടക്കേണ്ടി വന്നു .അവർക്ക് വ്യത്യസ്ത ഇടവേള സമയവും ഉണ്ടായിരുന്നു. ലൈംഗിക വിദ്യാഭ്യാസം ഇല്ലായിരുന്നു .ചെറിയ തെറ്റുകൾക്ക് അല്ലെങ്കിൽ ഒരു ഉത്തരം തെറ്റിയതിന് പോലും അവർ വിദ്യാർത്ഥികളെ തല്ലി , രക്തം വരുത്തി - ഞാന്‍ അത് ചൂണ്ടിക്കാണിച്ചു അപ്പോൾ എന്നെയും തല്ലി.  

3) മാനേജ്‌മെൻ്റും അധ്യാപകര്‍ തമ്മിൽ തർക്കം വേറെ , 
ചില അദ്ധ്യാപകർ നല്ലവരായിരുന്നു, എന്നാൽഭൂരിഭാഗവും എവറസ്റ്റിനെക്കാൾ ഉയർന്ന ഈഗോകൾ ഉള്ളവര്‍.  
കൂടുതൽ യോഗ്യതയുള്ള കോളേജ് അധ്യാപകർ അവരെക്കാൾ വിനയാന്വിതരായിരുന്നു. ചില അധ്യാപകർക്ക് ശരിയായ  ഇംഗ്ലീഷ് പോലും അറിയില്ല! 

4)പുതിയ യൂണിഫോം ചെലവേറിയതും കാലാവസ്ഥയ്ക്ക് അനുയോജ്യവുമല്ല ! 

5) ഇപ്പോൾ അവർ പ്രത്യേക ഐടി ക്ലാസുകൾക്ക് കൂടുതൽ നിരക്ക് ഈടാക്കുകയും അതിൻ്റെ അടിസ്ഥാനത്തിൽ വിദ്യാർത്ഥികളെ വേർതിരിക്കുകയും ചെയ്യുന്നു

6)നിങ്ങളുടെ കുട്ടിയുടെ സ്കൂൾ ജീവിതം മോശമായിരിക്കും , guarantee ! 

7) നല്ല മാർക്ക് കിട്ടുന്നത് അധ്യാപകരുടെയോ സ്കൂളിൻ്റെയോ കഴിവ് അല്ല അത്  വിദ്യാർത്ഥികളുടെ കഠിനാധ്വാനം കൊണ്ടാണ് എന്നത്‌ എപ്പോളും ഓര്‍ക്കുക. 

പൂജ്യം നക്ഷത്രങ്ങൾ ഇടാനുള്ള ഓപ്ഷൻ എനിക്കുണ്ടായിരുന്നെങ്കിൽ ഞാൻ അത് ചെയ്യുമായിരുന്നു. അതുകൊണ്ട്‌ please ഞാൻ അനുഭവിച്ചത് നിങ്ങളുടെ മക്കള്‍ക്ക് വരാതിരിക്കാന്‍ , ഇവിടെ join ചെയ്യരുത് !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

11/3/24, 8:35 PM - Sayanth: Alright, you asked for it, Sayanth. Gloves off. Let’s do this.

You’re a “tech enthusiast” with more laptops than friends, and you're out here trying to trick your GNOME Debian into looking like Garuda Linux. But why, exactly? So your computer can look as edgy as you want to be? Meanwhile, that Realtek adapter’s out here plotting its daily rebellion, and you're stuck reinstalling themes like it's a hobby.

And look at this social media lineup: Instagram, LinkedIn, Steam, and even WhatsApp. Man, your networking game is a treasure trove of self-promotion links, as if you're running a PR campaign for one person who might want to hire you. LinkedIn? For all those recruiters just dying to know how many hours you clocked in Red Dead Redemption 2? Because if anyone needs to know you’ve finished the epilogue five times, it’s a potential employer.

But hey, the highlight here has to be the project list. You’ve built an emotional support app, a cryptocurrency tracker, and an app called Pickme for pickup lines. That’s basically the Sayanth Starter Pack: cry about crypto prices, fail to flirt, and then go back to being an emotional support developer. You’re building apps to fill the void, but somewhere in your hard drive is just a big empty folder called “social life.”

And sure, you’ve got the whole “heavy metal and classical Indian music” thing going. It’s great that you can go from a deathcore scream to a Malayalam melody, but we all know that playlist’s just running on a loop while you meticulously clean every inch of your room. You’ve got OCD, so naturally, you're turning into Mr. Clean while still somehow being too paralyzed by social anxiety to speak to anyone except me.

And oh, those poor friends you do have. Bet they can’t wait for their regular TED Talk about KDE vs. GNOME, how to properly set up day and night themes, or the best way to implement animations in Linux. Meanwhile, they're thinking, “Please, can we just play Stardew Valley and pretend you're a functional human being?”

You’re the kind of person who finds comfort in machine learning predicting skin cancer but would probably freeze in terror if someone invited you to an actual human conversation. But hey, you're optimizing day trips! Just don't get too wild and accidentally optimize yourself right into having fun.

And let’s talk about the relationships situation. Romantic, platonic—doesn’t matter. You're more elusive than Bigfoot. You’ll share your Linux config files online but can’t manage a single friendship without treating it like an HTML form submission. But that’s okay! When all else fails, just whip up another app to help other people deal with their loneliness and anxiety. You know, like Pluto. It's always easier to code the solution for someone else than to deal with it yourself, right?

But hey, at least you've got the “perfect” GNOME Debian setup. Now if only you could theme your life to make friends come with a plug-and-play install.

6/14/24, 11:51 PM - Aishwarya: Oh nice
6/14/24, 11:57 PM - Aishwarya: I went downstairs, I usually don't take phone downstairs coz sometimes friends call
And then my parents might ask ,who is this
(not a big deal ,but they will think phone aanu ellathinum karanam 😂 that type of mindset  , probably it will lead to less freedom from parents )
My parents don't know that I have online friends or friends in general 
Coz they know I'm kind of not in contact with anyone from college also
6/14/24, 11:57 PM - Aishwarya: How many weeks vacation is there?

6/15/24, 12:03 AM - Aishwarya: It's a slang right 

Or literally its like that ?
6/15/24, 12:03 AM - Sayanth: Both
6/15/24, 12:03 AM - Aishwarya: Oh
6/15/24, 12:03 AM - Aishwarya: Okay
6/15/24, 12:03 AM - Sayanth: How did they meet tho?
6/15/24, 12:03 AM - Aishwarya: Will your parents allow you to go a city for post graduation?
6/15/24, 12:04 AM - Aishwarya: Arike app
6/15/24, 12:04 AM - Sayanth: Idk but njn povum enthayalum
6/15/24, 12:04 AM - Aishwarya: That time he was working in kerala
6/15/24, 12:04 AM - Aishwarya: He recently went to bangalore, few months ago
6/15/24, 12:04 AM - Sayanth: I see so it works
6/15/24, 12:05 AM - Aishwarya: Oh 
But parents support vende for fees etc 
Cities are costly, kind of
6/15/24, 12:05 AM - Aishwarya: Ya
6/15/24, 12:05 AM - Sayanth: On a scale of 1 to 10 how good looking is he
6/15/24, 12:05 AM - Sayanth: Yeah enganelum convince cheyynm
6/15/24, 12:08 AM - Aishwarya: I don't think it matters coz it's not for a hookup right or related stuff right 

I don't think looks matter for guys for pursuing serious relationships 
Unless they want a girl much better looking, but in that case money , charisma etc helps 

He is average looking 
He is 5'7 
Not fat ( when they met )
Now he has bit muscles etc though 
Average face but kind of nice
Dusky 

She is also similar in looks
She is 5'4 
Fit 
Dusky
6/15/24, 12:09 AM - Aishwarya: Lol haha 
Since you asked 
Said in detail 💀😂
6/15/24, 12:09 AM - Sayanth: Njn athrem pratheekshichilla
6/15/24, 12:10 AM - Sayanth: Looks matter dude it does very much
6/15/24, 12:10 AM - Sayanth: Think of all the guys who were behind u
6/15/24, 12:10 AM - Sayanth: Now compare it to the no of girls behind me
6/15/24, 12:10 AM - Aishwarya: But he had a job when he met 
She was studying in abroad ( a year course)
Now she has job 
But his is better paying 
But he didn't want a girl with too good job anyways ( he had told so)
6/15/24, 12:10 AM - Sayanth: Athentha angane
6/15/24, 12:11 AM - Aishwarya: But also ,even then having job not necessary unless they are beyond a certain age , say 25 probably
6/15/24, 12:11 AM - Sayanth: Tbh in my case I need someone with good personality, like that person should be intelligent to some extend and good GK
6/15/24, 12:11 AM - Aishwarya: Upto that age , having potential in a good enough job probably
6/15/24, 12:11 AM - Aishwarya: Hehe
6/15/24, 12:12 AM - Sayanth: Even friends aanel polum I can't be with them unless they have a personality on their own
6/15/24, 12:13 AM - Aishwarya: Yes it matters 

But if a guy is average ,but nice enough looking to the girl ,that is enough 
Usually in relationships the guy and girl are of similar attractiveness, sometimes the girl looks better
6/15/24, 12:14 AM - Aishwarya: Nobody was behind me 🥲😂😂
6/15/24, 12:14 AM - Sayanth: Eh u had told me about some guys
6/15/24, 12:15 AM - Aishwarya: Yea but I liked them first though 
And they were not behind me 
I was like second option to last option to them
6/15/24, 12:16 AM - Sayanth: At least oru option enkilum aayirunnu
6/15/24, 12:16 AM - Sayanth: See the positive
6/15/24, 12:16 AM - Aishwarya: And I had asked out a guy , he had rejected me 
( he was dating a girl at the time, that i didnt know of ,so that was also a reason)
6/15/24, 12:16 AM - Sayanth: otherwise he would have prolly accepted you
6/15/24, 12:17 AM - Aishwarya: Plus he didn't want to commit to that girl even 

He was like let me see if some better girl is there in junior batch 
We were first year that time
6/15/24, 12:17 AM - Sayanth: Oh yeah there are some like that
6/15/24, 12:18 AM - Aishwarya: You told two girls liked you right 😅
But you were not interested in them 
Which happens
6/15/24, 12:18 AM - Sayanth: But for me at least 6 months okke edukkum to fall for someone
6/15/24, 12:18 AM - Sayanth: Yeah
6/15/24, 12:18 AM - Sayanth: One was too young
6/15/24, 12:18 AM - Sayanth: We were in 9th
6/15/24, 12:18 AM - Sayanth: Other was in 12th std
6/15/24, 12:18 AM - Sayanth: But she was obsessed
6/15/24, 12:19 AM - Sayanth: Kinda toxic
6/15/24, 12:19 AM - Aishwarya: No yaar 

And after I saw he saw his girlfriend also as a option ,in my mind I was like not a loss anyways
6/15/24, 12:19 AM - Aishwarya: Ya
6/15/24, 12:19 AM - Sayanth: Yeah it's his loss
6/15/24, 12:20 AM - Aishwarya: I don't believe in love for the most part 

But I like someone within few minutes to few days 💀😅😂
6/15/24, 12:20 AM - Aishwarya: Oh
6/15/24, 12:20 AM - Aishwarya: Oh okay
6/15/24, 12:21 AM - Sayanth: I can't fall for someone without getting to know their personality
6/15/24, 12:21 AM - Aishwarya: Yea bad for her 

Good for you actually 
In way 
But obsession is bad for the other person if it leads to stalking
6/15/24, 12:21 AM - Sayanth: So it's really hard to even get a crush on someone
6/15/24, 12:22 AM - Aishwarya: But an idea of their personality can be known within few days though

But I get the point
6/15/24, 12:23 AM - Aishwarya: Oh okay 
That's good and bad 

Bad coz it's boring 
Imo ,for me
6/15/24, 12:23 AM - Sayanth: Yeah but I want to know if they can be trusted
6/15/24, 12:23 AM - Sayanth: Yeah college IL crush undarnel oru povan motivation undavum
6/15/24, 12:24 AM - Aishwarya: Oh btw 

If one girl was obsessed  , it means you have potential 🫡
6/15/24, 12:24 AM - Sayanth: I wish
6/15/24, 12:24 AM - Sayanth: That's true
6/15/24, 12:25 AM - Aishwarya: Yea but not in same class though 🥲😂
Or probably it's just me ,coz I have social anxiety 
But most of the irl crushes happens like that
6/15/24, 12:25 AM - Aishwarya: By logic
6/15/24, 12:26 AM - Aishwarya: Logically possibility und
6/15/24, 12:28 AM - Sayanth: Aa crush adth varumbo anxiety koodum
6/15/24, 12:28 AM - Sayanth: Normal aan
6/15/24, 12:28 AM - Aishwarya: Okay , so why you felt so though
6/15/24, 12:28 AM - Sayanth: Because I think beauty wise you look prettier than I do
6/15/24, 12:28 AM - Aishwarya: Coz you literally had someone obsessed with you 

Girls don't get obsessed usually, unlike guys imo
6/15/24, 12:29 AM - Aishwarya: 💀 what 
Any grammar mistakes?
6/15/24, 12:30 AM - Sayanth: No
6/15/24, 12:30 AM - Aishwarya: Ya
6/15/24, 12:30 AM - Aishwarya: I don't know what to say coz that's not true 💀
6/15/24, 12:31 AM - Sayanth: Check ur pfp again
6/15/24, 12:31 AM - Sayanth: See that smile of urs
6/15/24, 12:31 AM - Sayanth: I don't even know how to smile tbh
6/15/24, 12:33 AM - Aishwarya: Actually I look better in photos 
I'm photogenic
6/15/24, 12:34 AM - Aishwarya: Yea, my features are kind of okay 
And this pfp some people have said I have nice smile
6/15/24, 12:34 AM - Aishwarya: You are learn it
6/15/24, 12:34 AM - Sayanth: In my case I don't look good in irl or fotos
6/15/24, 12:34 AM - Aishwarya: Your features are kind of nice too 
Plus you are fair no
6/15/24, 12:35 AM - Sayanth: Athonnum + points alla I think
6/15/24, 12:35 AM - Sayanth: Idk njn try cheythu to smile but for some reason it always goes wrong
6/15/24, 12:37 AM - Aishwarya: I think most fair people look better irl or the same 
But depends though 
Few of my friends from college ( girls) are like that
6/15/24, 12:38 AM - Aishwarya: You can learn it 
Confidence is key
6/15/24, 12:39 AM - Aishwarya: Oh you really think so ?🤔
6/15/24, 12:40 AM - Aishwarya: Not everyone can look that attractive ,in that way yes 
Depends on what standards you have for yourself 
Don't be too hard on yourself
6/15/24, 12:41 AM - Sayanth: I guess
6/15/24, 12:42 AM - Sayanth: BTW I wanted to ask do u not go out with friends?
6/15/24, 12:44 AM - Aishwarya: No 
I don't have any irl friends 
But I don't really want to though 
I want to find my vibe friends  
I want to move to Bangalore or abroad for that ( one of the reasons )
6/15/24, 12:44 AM - Aishwarya: And I know that I can't be true friends with people who want kids especially women
6/15/24, 12:44 AM - Sayanth: Oh
6/15/24, 12:45 AM - Aishwarya: I know what I want in friendship ,and so many don't fit the vibe
6/15/24, 12:46 AM - Aishwarya: And I have this reminder that I had to kind of cut off my close friend in college coz she was not my vibe 
She is one of the nicest girls ever I have met irl <This message was edited>
6/15/24, 12:46 AM - Sayanth: Now I feel bad for her
6/15/24, 12:47 AM - Aishwarya: Why 😅
She is extroverted, she has many friends ,not a loss for her
6/15/24, 12:48 AM - Sayanth: That's what u think
6/15/24, 12:48 AM - Sayanth: May be she thinks otherwise
6/15/24, 12:49 AM - Aishwarya: The thing is I believe I have cognitive empathy 
So I'm always nice to my friends but I don't get that much in return 
But at the same time ,I'm not a selfless person either, so I get disappointed and might even get grudges on them 
Not healthy for me 

Meanwhile them ,they can cross another friend's boundaries and then forget about it after a week and be friends again ( either that or they are faking it )
6/15/24, 12:50 AM - Sayanth: Yeah totally relatable
6/15/24, 12:50 AM - Sayanth: Enikkum same feel cheyyarund sometimes
6/15/24, 12:50 AM - Sayanth: Here's a song a for you
6/15/24, 12:50 AM - Sayanth: https://open.spotify.com/track/4NknsYwkHVIeCxEq18UXCv?si=vv1_9J1XTomr9R8p7PlkpA
6/15/24, 12:53 AM - Aishwarya: I remember her telling about her breakup to me ,and telling me not say about it to anyone ( during that time)
I think at the time I was her favorite friend 

But the truth was I didn't really like her coz of something she did ( despite she did it knowingly or unknowingly )

I think this is the reality of many friendships ( one or both persons not liking the other due to whatever reasons)
But good healthy friendships are there too
6/15/24, 12:54 AM - Aishwarya: Thanks for the recommendation
6/15/24, 12:55 AM - Sayanth: Lyrics might be relatable to you
6/15/24, 12:55 AM - Aishwarya: Remembering this helps with fomo 
Sometimes I feel I'm missing out by not having enough friends etc 
But I remember that I was not happier when I had more friends
6/15/24, 12:55 AM - Sayanth: Aha
6/15/24, 12:56 AM - Sayanth: Can we talk tomorrow
6/15/24, 12:56 AM - Sayanth: I'm sleepy af rn

6/15/24, 10:18 PM - Aishwarya: Thanks
6/15/24, 10:20 PM - Aishwarya: Having what qualities do you consider as good friends ? For you
6/15/24, 10:22 PM - Aishwarya: Also do you like if friends check in on you everyday? Or you find it boring
6/15/24, 10:22 PM - Sayanth: Oh yeah that's good
6/15/24, 10:22 PM - Sayanth: Who would find that boring!
6/15/24, 10:23 PM - Sayanth: Well they should care about me
6/15/24, 10:38 PM - Aishwarya: There was a power cut for 3 minutes or so ,wifi went off
Had went downstairs to recharge mobile data
I hadn't recharged phone in a few days
6/15/24, 10:39 PM - Aishwarya: Okay then 
Just to make sure I asked
6/15/24, 10:39 PM - Aishwarya: Some people find it boring
6/15/24, 10:40 PM - Aishwarya: Okay 
What other qualities do you consider in a good friend?
Let me try to be that
6/15/24, 10:47 PM - Aishwarya: I like your vibe ,so I wanted to be friends 
So for that, I should be a good friend for you also right 
What can I do to be that
6/15/24, 10:50 PM - Aishwarya: You said checking in on you everyday, that you like 

But do let me know if at some point ,you find it boring
Or you want to change it to every other day later ,things like that 

Coz i will be messaging you everyday to check up on you from today
6/15/24, 10:54 PM - Sayanth: oh
6/15/24, 10:55 PM - Sayanth: honesty
6/15/24, 10:55 PM - Sayanth: i like people when they are brutally honest
6/15/24, 10:55 PM - Aishwarya: Oh okay
6/15/24, 10:57 PM - Sayanth: yeah and i kinda hate liars
6/15/24, 10:57 PM - Sayanth: too much
6/15/24, 10:57 PM - Sayanth: for some reason i cant just get along with those
6/15/24, 10:57 PM - Aishwarya: Okay
6/15/24, 10:57 PM - Aishwarya: Okay
6/15/24, 10:58 PM - Aishwarya: When was the last time you felt that one of your friends lied ?
Could use some context to get an idea
6/15/24, 10:59 PM - Sayanth: oh u dont have to text me everyday . im not saying you should not i'd appreciate it if u do but just be yourself thats all you can text me whenever u want . if u want to talk every day thats great too but just be yourself
6/15/24, 10:59 PM - Aishwarya: I think one of the lies I remember is ,someone said they don't have previous year question papers, but they did <This message was edited>
6/15/24, 11:01 PM - Sayanth: yeah that was when that girl said i wasn't making her uncomfortable but in reality i was but that was because i had feelings for her
6/15/24, 11:02 PM - Sayanth: and she didn't wanna tell me even tho i had asked her if im doing something wrong so i could correct it or just stop texting if im bothering her
6/15/24, 11:02 PM - Aishwarya: Oh okay 

In my case ,even if I don't text my friends everything they are sometimes on my mind 
Coz good friends make people happy, and happy things stay in people's minds 

So I don't want my friends to check up on me usually 

But if some friend want that ,I like doing that 
It depends on what people's love languages in friendship is 
How they feel cared for ( for different people ,it's different)
6/15/24, 11:02 PM - Sayanth: yeah i guess
6/15/24, 11:03 PM - Aishwarya: Oh okay
6/15/24, 11:03 PM - Sayanth: even if its a small thing i just hate lying
6/15/24, 11:07 PM - Aishwarya: Oh in my case if a guy was interested in me and I'm not ( hypothetically )
I wouldn't feel uncomfortable if he wants to talk , coz I can still be friends with that guy 
Atleast I wouldn't feel any different than how I feel towards others people 

But I wouldn't want to lead that person on though ,so I will say to them I'm not interested in more than being a friend 

( for context I have been led on, kind of intentionally but by crushes though  )
6/15/24, 11:07 PM - Aishwarya: Oh okay
I remember the story
She kind of put some fake allegations on you
6/15/24, 11:08 PM - Sayanth: not exactly allegations id say
6/15/24, 11:08 PM - Sayanth: but yeah called me creep
6/15/24, 11:08 PM - Sayanth: and i was scaring her
6/15/24, 11:08 PM - Sayanth: kinda stuff
6/15/24, 11:09 PM - Aishwarya: Oh okay 
That makes sense 
I don't lie 
Probably sometimes I did with someone ,can't remember 

But generally no ,especially towards a good friend no
6/15/24, 11:09 PM - Aishwarya: Yea that only I meant 

I remember
6/15/24, 11:09 PM - Aishwarya: Yea I remember the story
6/15/24, 11:13 PM - Aishwarya: Last I lied was with that friend I told about 
He had lied to me first 

So I needed to vent about it to three people or so 
But I didn't tell them who he is or anything 
I just wanted to get it off my mind ,venting helps 

So later when he asked me ,if I told about him to anyone ,I said no
6/15/24, 11:16 PM - Aishwarya: But I have told him that it's not close friends anymore 
But he keeps lying ,idk for what 

Acting like he wants to be friends with me ; feels like a trap to get me attached only to ghost later or something
6/15/24, 11:16 PM - Aishwarya: So I'm not acting like a good friend to him ,coz I don't really like him anymore
6/15/24, 11:17 PM - Aishwarya: If I don't like a friend anymore ,I don't have the energy to fake it 
What's the point
6/15/24, 11:17 PM - Sayanth: That's understandable
6/15/24, 11:17 PM - Aishwarya: But I know some people who do it 
But irl friendships though 
I think it's coz they want a friend clique for the clout
6/15/24, 11:18 PM - Sayanth: Yeah most of the girl who studied with me in 9th and 10th were like that
6/15/24, 11:18 PM - Aishwarya: There was a squad goals type of girl group from my class 
Some of them secretly didn't like each other 
But they would post themselves on IG to flex how cool their friendship is
6/15/24, 11:19 PM - Sayanth: There was this one girl who's so extroverted she used bitch about another girl classmate of us
6/15/24, 11:19 PM - Sayanth: I just once casually mentioned that she's really hardworking and the other girl started saying all the shitty things about her
6/15/24, 11:19 PM - Aishwarya: For such people it makes sense 
I mean I also like to post such stuff on IG ,so no judgements 

But I don't have the energy to fake it 
I wish I was wired like that though ,life would be less stressful , and more chill and cool then
6/15/24, 11:20 PM - Sayanth: But irl she acts like her best friend
6/15/24, 11:20 PM - Aishwarya: Oh
6/15/24, 11:20 PM - Aishwarya: Oh 💀😂
6/15/24, 11:20 PM - Aishwarya: Oh
6/15/24, 11:20 PM - Aishwarya: Nice 💀
6/15/24, 11:26 PM - Sayanth: Boys do the same thing but girls irl acts like they are soul mates for some reason
6/15/24, 11:26 PM - Sayanth: A lot of drama
6/15/24, 11:26 PM - Sayanth: Straight out of netflix
6/15/24, 11:26 PM - Aishwarya: Yea
6/15/24, 11:26 PM - Aishwarya: True
6/15/24, 11:26 PM - Aishwarya: Yea😂
6/15/24, 11:30 PM - Sayanth: Do u watch any series ?
6/15/24, 11:30 PM - Aishwarya: No
6/15/24, 11:31 PM - Aishwarya: But I watch edits that come up in my YouTube shorts
6/15/24, 11:31 PM - Sayanth: Great
6/15/24, 11:31 PM - Sayanth: Here's a lame joke
6/15/24, 11:31 PM - Aishwarya: Say
6/15/24, 11:31 PM - Sayanth: Why did the chicken cross the road ?
6/15/24, 11:32 PM - Aishwarya: Coz it wanted to duh
6/15/24, 11:32 PM - Aishwarya: 🤣
6/15/24, 11:32 PM - Aishwarya: Lol
6/15/24, 11:32 PM - Sayanth: No
6/15/24, 11:33 PM - Sayanth: To meet the idiot
6/15/24, 11:33 PM - Aishwarya: Why
6/15/24, 11:33 PM - Aishwarya: Oh lame joke right 
So makes sense
6/15/24, 11:33 PM - Sayanth: Knock knock
6/15/24, 11:33 PM - Aishwarya: Who is there
6/15/24, 11:33 PM - Sayanth: The chicken
6/15/24, 11:34 PM - Aishwarya: Chicken who
6/15/24, 11:34 PM - Sayanth: The one who crossed the road to meet the idiot
6/15/24, 11:34 PM - Sayanth: Sahrhddhahahdb
6/15/24, 11:34 PM - Aishwarya: I didn't understand 🥲🥹
6/15/24, 11:35 PM - Sayanth: You are the idiot
6/15/24, 11:35 PM - Aishwarya: Lol
6/15/24, 11:35 PM - Aishwarya: Okay haha
6/15/24, 11:35 PM - Aishwarya: 💀
6/15/24, 11:35 PM - Aishwarya: Did you read it somewhere ? <This message was edited>
6/15/24, 11:36 PM - Sayanth: No I guess
6/15/24, 11:36 PM - Aishwarya: Oh nice

6/15/24, 11:36 PM - Aishwarya: Oh okay

Reddit 
Or reels
6/15/24, 11:43 PM - Aishwarya: Do you like friends sharing reels with you ?
6/15/24, 11:43 PM - Sayanth: Yeah
6/15/24, 11:43 PM - Aishwarya: What kind of reels you like ?( outside of news etc)
6/15/24, 11:44 PM - Sayanth: Oh jokes
6/15/24, 11:44 PM - Aishwarya: Okay
6/15/24, 11:44 PM - Sayanth: Anything funny
6/15/24, 11:45 PM - Aishwarya: I have a friend who send me lot of reels everyday 
Most of them are funny 
But sometimes I view it after a few days ,coz I get sensory overload sometimes
6/15/24, 11:45 PM - Aishwarya: I also send her reels 
But my reels are not as interesting as hers
6/15/24, 11:45 PM - Sayanth: Yeah same here I don't get much time to watch reels
6/15/24, 11:45 PM - Aishwarya: Okay ,yea true
6/15/24, 11:46 PM - Sayanth: It doesn't have to be interesting but you do tho
6/15/24, 11:46 PM - Sayanth: For me sending reels is kinda my way of showing affection
6/15/24, 11:46 PM - Aishwarya: Okay, yea
6/15/24, 11:48 PM - Aishwarya: And also staying in contact actually 
There was one friend ,we used to communicate through reels coz we ran out of topics to talk about
6/15/24, 11:48 PM - Sayanth: Oh
6/15/24, 11:48 PM - Sayanth: Yeah that I do as well
6/15/24, 11:49 PM - Aishwarya: Okay
6/15/24, 11:49 PM - Aishwarya: Btw would you like to call someday ? 
Only if you are comfortable with it
6/15/24, 11:50 PM - Aishwarya: This friend ,me and she called after months and she was talking so smoothly meanwhile I was struggling a bit
6/15/24, 11:50 PM - Sayanth: Yeah may be
6/15/24, 11:51 PM - Sayanth: But it'll take some time
6/15/24, 11:51 PM - Sayanth: I'm toooooooo shyyyy
6/15/24, 11:52 PM - Aishwarya: Oh that's okay 
No worries 
I'm awkward too 💀
Silence is okay
6/15/24, 11:52 PM - Sayanth: Oh lol
6/15/24, 11:52 PM - Aishwarya: Ya
6/15/24, 11:56 PM - Sayanth: Also any progress about ur crush situation
6/15/24, 11:58 PM - Aishwarya: I want to date him when and if I move to bangalore 
But mostly only if he gets snipped 
It's like a wishlist kind of thing 
But probably by that time I might not even like him anymore 
I used to be lowkey obsessed with my previous crush too ,it's a good feeling ,even though there are disappointing times sometimes
6/16/24, 12:07 AM - Sayanth: I'm seriously asking again why don't u try making a dating profile tho
6/16/24, 12:08 AM - Aishwarya: Oh ,i can't date as of now 
I have to move out
6/16/24, 12:08 AM - Sayanth: I mean u don't have to rn but at least may text them
6/16/24, 12:09 AM - Aishwarya: I actually don't like most guys character 😅
6/16/24, 12:10 AM - Sayanth: Same here I can't find someone to swipe right
6/16/24, 12:10 AM - Aishwarya: Even my crush's character I don't really like much 💀
6/16/24, 12:10 AM - Sayanth: But may be you might get lucky
6/16/24, 12:11 AM - Aishwarya: Oh girls character is much better than guys imo 

But on dating apps the gender ratio is off ,so it not effective much for guys there ,that i know
6/16/24, 12:13 AM - Aishwarya: Generally its like that imo 
Girls character is better than guys 

 But good guys are gem
6/16/24, 12:13 AM - Aishwarya: And imo good guys tend to better than good girls
6/16/24, 12:14 AM - Aishwarya: I mean in that order I like
6/16/24, 12:14 AM - Aishwarya: Coz in my observations it tend to be like that
6/16/24, 12:19 AM - Aishwarya: In terms of being good people, it tend to be like that I mean
6/16/24, 9:30 AM - Sayanth: yeah that id agree
6/16/24, 9:31 AM - Sayanth: if u take an average boy and average girl idk honestly the avg boy would be not exactly good
6/16/24, 9:33 AM - Sayanth: but i was talking about having a unique personality as far as i know almost all the female classmates of mine have this generic personality basic tastes and all like they juist follow the trend no one has  any unique traits . most boys are same tho but still a bit slightly different than girls
6/16/24, 12:33 PM - Aishwarya: Exactly good in what?
6/16/24, 12:34 PM - Aishwarya: Oh 

For me I don't mind about taste in stuff and having generic personality 
But many are annoying I meant
6/16/24, 12:35 PM - Sayanth: Like they would be less empathetic and bit more toxic
6/16/24, 12:35 PM - Aishwarya: Oh okay
6/16/24, 12:36 PM - Aishwarya: Agree
6/16/24, 12:37 PM - Sayanth: It's like you know some people don't have anything interesting like they don't have anything to talk about they don't have their own opinions but solely follow someone else's opinions and trends
6/16/24, 12:38 PM - Aishwarya: Oh okay 
True
6/16/24, 1:03 PM - Sayanth: Also

If food also there in the date ,then eat in style 
Eye contact but not too much 
Don't look at phone much
Compliment her in a way she likes 
Search on conversation topics etc from internet

And take yourself too
6/18/24, 4:41 PM - Aishwarya: So what about dating app pics then 
Anyways keep pics in handy 
Maybe some girl will ask for them 
Or you can just simply casually to this girl for example
6/18/24, 4:42 PM - Aishwarya: Okay nice 🫣
6/18/24, 4:42 PM - Aishwarya: Nice pics
6/18/24, 4:43 PM - Aishwarya: If you know her favorite colors, maybe that ones will be better outfits
6/18/24, 4:44 PM - Sayanth: I don't have that much outfits
6/18/24, 4:44 PM - Sayanth: Aake 2 shirts und

6/18/24, 4:45 PM - Sayanth: Pnne 4 t shirts 2 black one green 1 blue
6/18/24, 4:45 PM - Sayanth: Yeah
6/18/24, 4:45 PM - Aishwarya: Maybe wear the newest pair then 
You will look good in anything
6/18/24, 4:45 PM - Sayanth: I wasn't confident enough to wear shirts
6/18/24, 4:45 PM - Sayanth: 
6/18/24, 4:47 PM - Aishwarya: Oh but in this pic ,it's nice only 
So maybe you can buy shirts later 

But for now good tshirts undengil that would be good 
But idk if that will be too casual

You could have send in non disappearing pics but it's okay haha

6/18/24, 4:49 PM - Aishwarya: Yes that shirt looks good 
But idk if it's the lighting something off in the shirt 
But that shirt is better than the black one ,coz it's uncolor
6/18/24, 4:50 PM - Aishwarya: Yes flower design shirts I like 
Don't know in general what girls prefer though 
But i think in general this shirt looks better than the other

6/20/24, 11:49 PM - Sayanth: How are u
6/20/24, 11:49 PM - Sayanth: !?
6/21/24, 1:00 AM - Aishwarya: Hey
6/21/24, 1:00 AM - Aishwarya: I'm fine
6/21/24, 1:00 AM - Aishwarya: How are you
6/21/24, 1:02 AM - Sayanth: Oh where were u
6/21/24, 1:02 AM - Sayanth: !?
6/21/24, 1:02 AM - Sayanth: Yeah about
6/21/24, 1:02 AM - Sayanth: That
6/21/24, 1:03 AM - Sayanth: After a long time I'm finally able to have a crush on someone one
6/21/24, 1:10 AM - Aishwarya: I was engaged in some stuff
6/21/24, 1:10 AM - Aishwarya: Oh , that's good
6/21/24, 1:25 AM - Aishwarya: You want to talk about it?
6/21/24, 1:25 AM - Aishwarya: I'm open to listening
6/21/24, 1:27 AM - Aishwarya: You said you used to listen to some people and they didn't right ( I like to believe its true ,coz that's a good quality yk)
So I want to help you 
In return maybe you can help me as well ,similarly
6/21/24, 1:41 AM - Aishwarya: Oh and there is something 
I prefer being friends with girls who are girls girls ,the most 
But I haven't found them yet ,except one girl who is my vibe 
And maybe guys who are not a bad person plus guys who are fair and cute 
And I support them having kids 
Friends or not ,I root for them having kids 

Like the other guys I feel offended when they like other girls 
And also I feel offended when they are having kids even ( maybe I will explain that later )

If I'm friends with someone ,i want good for them 
And want to support and root for them 

It's related to my main traumas related to skin colour ( so I can't offer my support system for people who contribute to such traumas for other female children) idk if that makes sense
6/21/24, 1:43 AM - Aishwarya: I told about one of my previous guy friends right 
I really supported him 
All I wanted from his side was being a not bad person 
No other expectations
6/21/24, 1:44 AM - Aishwarya: Bad person in the sense not overtly misogynistic etc 
But he turned out to be kind of bad in some other way 
Still I'm in talking terms with him ,even though I don't consider him a friend
6/21/24, 1:45 AM - Aishwarya: After I became childfree ,I had this phase that I didn't really like people who are having kids ( not all ,but the people that mentioned )
6/21/24, 1:48 AM - Aishwarya: So after I met him ,I used to root for him 
I used to say that may he meet a girl of his dreams ,have cute kids etc
He was the first non childfree person that I supported 
Also i felt better about myself coz afterall I'm not a hater without any reason ( I just don't support certain people having kids )
6/21/24, 1:54 AM - Aishwarya: The fair guys who are decent looking ,they don't like me 
Or maybe a few might like me a bit 
Like my crush 
Either ways I don't mind 
And I don't really care 
And I'm definitely not offended coz they are fair themselves right 
In my crush case ,its bit different 
But I felt the same towards my previous crush also ,now I don't care about him at all 

Meanwhile the guys who are not fair, whatever small incidents I'm still offended 
Coz dare they 
And also I feel some resentment for those typical ones who will be having kids ,coz how dare they
6/21/24, 2:04 AM - Aishwarya: Plus I wanted to say something else too 

I know that I called you cute multiple times ,it's true imo 
( main reason is to support you btw ,please don't take it wrongly, especially coz I'm much older than you, coz of that i dont want to come across that way yk
Otherwise also  )
 
Also I think girls don't give guys enough compliments ,I'm not sure 
And guys complimenting other guys ,like girls do with each other , is seen as bit gay 
So that way also guys don't get enough compliments
Probably for genz is different 
That is also a reason I wanted to remind you and support you
6/21/24, 2:13 AM - Aishwarya: Just wanted to say in advance 
Coz I will be saying like that many times 💀😂
It might come across as lowkey flirting ,but it's not actually 
I do it with my female friends also 

But yea I will be more of a formal type of friend once you get a girlfriend 
Or when you are serious with a girl 
( coz then that girl will have some boundaries right )
6/21/24, 2:24 AM - Aishwarya: Mostly I want to be an emotional support friend to people I like 
And them to me 
Preferably girls 
I'm buzy, so like one or two people
6/21/24, 2:26 AM - Aishwarya: Even just to them is okay too 
Coz sometimes some people are not good listeners
6/21/24, 2:27 AM - Aishwarya: But I should like them as persons 
And feel happy rooting for them
6/21/24, 2:32 AM - Aishwarya: Many months ago ,I was looking to make a listener friend 
And some guys ,they were only open to being listeners to some girl they were dating ( which is valid )
Or want to date 
And I'm not looking to date or anything 
Not that they will like me anyways
6/21/24, 2:33 AM - Aishwarya: And coz you said that you listened to some girl you were not interested in dating 
That was so wholesome 🥹🫡
6/21/24, 2:33 AM - Aishwarya: Which is something i liked the most about you
6/21/24, 2:36 AM - Aishwarya: One of my guy friends, I told about , he was like that too 
Which is wholesome and appreciated 

But he had to be disappointing in some other way 🥺 as a person
6/21/24, 2:46 AM - Aishwarya: But idk how much of a good listener friend you can be to me 
So it's okay ,you don't necessarily have to be that for me 

But I can listen to you 
I like your energy 
And you seem non problematic 
So I would like to help you in ways I can , by being a supportive friend
6/21/24, 2:59 AM - Aishwarya: But like a low maintenance friend, in terms of time spend 
Coz I'm busy with studies 

Plus I used to spend so much time interacting with the previous friend I told about ,and he turnt out to be soo disappointing 
We used to talk in call for 1 hour to 2 hours per day, or every two days 
Platonic friendship and interactions it was 
( I actually did it ,coz I thought I can built a solid friendship to rely on , coz he used to listen to me sometimes when in need ,and he used to feel like a safe space).

Also, he was fair and cute 
So I didn't feel offended or anything, that he didn't find me cute back 
He did tell so ,but that was a lie ,he was being nice ,I could tell from the vibe 
But that and all didnt matter to me ,coz i just expected a good friend to me ,from him 

( I had other type of interactions with a few men rarely , in those cases I don't really consider how much of a good person that guy is ,just if he is attracted enough to me etc 
It was some white guys online mainly , coz i wanted some validation )
6/21/24, 7:21 AM - Sayanth: Dude I'm only half way through your texts
6/21/24, 7:21 AM - Sayanth: I'll finish it but
6/21/24, 7:21 AM - Sayanth: Dude whaaaat
6/21/24, 7:22 AM - Sayanth: See I see you as a friend and I think I was pretty much open with you about almost everything
6/21/24, 7:23 AM - Sayanth: Also we have a lot to talk
6/21/24, 7:24 AM - Sayanth: First of all I'm not gonna leave u or cut contacts if that makes u feel better cuz idk I need reassurance frequently
6/21/24, 7:26 AM - Sayanth: Also I'm not lying I don't lie but you really look pretty you don't have to compare dude
6/21/24, 7:26 AM - Sayanth: But either way u are cute and pretty
6/21/24, 7:26 AM - Sayanth: Also yeah I'm not gonna get a gf any time soon
6/21/24, 7:26 AM - Sayanth: So no worries
6/21/24, 10:55 AM - Aishwarya: Okay then
6/21/24, 10:58 AM - Aishwarya: Yea that I know
But i just said
6/21/24, 10:58 AM - Aishwarya: I didn't understand the last part
6/21/24, 11:00 AM - Sayanth: Oh as someone who has anxiety disorder enikk edak edak reassurance venm although I've learned to live without it now.
6/21/24, 11:00 AM - Sayanth: So I thought giving u reassurance might make u feel better
6/21/24, 11:00 AM - Aishwarya: Oh okay
6/21/24, 11:01 AM - Sayanth: Dude I can listen
6/21/24, 11:01 AM - Sayanth: I love listening to you tbh
6/21/24, 11:01 AM - Aishwarya: Reassurance that your friends are not gonna leave ?
6/21/24, 11:01 AM - Aishwarya: Okay 🥹
6/21/24, 11:01 AM - Sayanth: But last day I was busy things
6/21/24, 11:01 AM - Aishwarya: Okay then
6/21/24, 11:01 AM - Sayanth: Yeah angane ellem
6/21/24, 11:03 AM - Aishwarya: In this context ,reassurance means ? 
Like calling you cute etc, aano

But I don't mind btw ,I was just curious 
Anyways I root for certain people
6/21/24, 11:04 AM - Sayanth: No like I'm burdening, enikk edakkoke if I'm bothering u with all this texting angane okke thoughts verum that's all <This message was edited>
6/21/24, 11:05 AM - Aishwarya: Oh okay ,got it
6/21/24, 11:09 AM - Aishwarya: That you don't have to worry at all 
Enik bother aavunna few things ae ullu 
Like intolerable misogyny etc ,in guys 
You are not like that 
Plus the other reasons i told in detail ,why I like being friends with you
6/21/24, 11:21 AM - Aishwarya: You know there was guy 
He is childfree, and cute and fair 
Out of my league 
That combination is something I really respect 
I never saw him as more than a friend ,mostly coz he is out of my league 
I get interested only in guys who I have chance with  
Something related to responsive desire and stuff 

But I used to praise him and stuff 
Which I don't mind , actually I like it 
And I like it when girls in general compliment certain guys ( fair cute guys for example )

Coz some guys who are darker skin toned have this audacity to think ,skin colour don't apply to them 
This is type of guys that I dislike one of the most 


And I like all girls ( unless they are not girls girls in my definition)
Plus one type of girl that I really dislike is the fair girls who don't stick to fair guys 
Coz in my mind , they are one of reason for some of my traumas ,indirectly
6/21/24, 11:24 AM - Aishwarya: Oh I forgot to continue that story 
So that guy didn't like me or found me cute or anything 
Which like I said I don't really get offended or anything 

If they do ,then fine ,that's all 
It's validation in general 
But doesn't really matter ,in the sense either ways no issue
6/21/24, 11:28 AM - Aishwarya: And he knows that skin colour is my main insecurity 
Coz I think my life experiences would be different if I was fair 
But I see it as I was born for some things ,and my experiences and the way I see things , it's to make some changes 
And one of it is I want to lowkey inspire more women to be childfree, and men too 
Especially the ones related to reasons why I'm myself childfree 
( my skin colour )
Plus ofcourse other reasons as well
6/21/24, 11:28 AM - Aishwarya: But one day he was saying a story about ,how one girl had crush on him for more than 10 years
6/21/24, 11:30 AM - Aishwarya: He is 35 now 
They studied in the same college 
She is married now 
He said still she has crush on him 
She got married 5 years or so ago 
( idk if his story was cap though)
6/21/24, 11:33 AM - Aishwarya: I was interested in the story ,coz I have only known married men being this way 

Coz men are way more visual than women 
Some guys who get married to other girls ,still like other girls in their mind 
Some might act on them if they can ,some might not ( coz guys also have conscience and morals ,even though they are biologically wired to be more visual )
6/21/24, 11:35 AM - Aishwarya: So for more context about the story  ,I asked him if he liked her back at any point ( I haven't seen her or know what she look like ,and actually I didn't ask about that part )
6/21/24, 11:36 AM - Aishwarya: So he says ,nah never liked her ,I like fair cute girls
6/21/24, 11:37 AM - Aishwarya: Like I don't mind ,but I felt that it was an unnecessary description 
Especially coz he knows about my insecurities and stuff
6/21/24, 11:38 AM - Aishwarya: And also in next message, he sends me an Instagram link of a mallu girl in white saree ( some onam pic )
6/21/24, 11:38 AM - Aishwarya: He is kannadiga
6/21/24, 11:40 AM - Aishwarya: I felt like the whole thing was unnecessary 
I'm still not mad at him or anything 
Coz imo fair guys can behave like whatever and I don't really care 

I might not want to be friends though 

But when darker skin guys do all this ,I get triggered 
Coz I get reminded of them being like that, and going on to have daughters like me 
It's my trigger
6/21/24, 11:41 AM - Aishwarya: And then slowly the friendship drifted apart 
I didn't feel like he was a good listener also 

He made me feel bad about the way I felt about certain topics in general 
One of the main reasons
6/21/24, 11:44 AM - Aishwarya: But the one other thing I respected about him is that ,he is someone who is not having fuck boy attitude towards women 
Or obsessed with scoring cute women and bed them 
He lived in bangalore
Has his own home etc 
He had dated two women before 
But he is a virgin at 35 
So I had some soft corner for him
6/21/24, 11:44 AM - Aishwarya: So after we were no longer friends also ,I had recommended him to two girls ( who were fair and cute )
6/21/24, 11:45 AM - Aishwarya: Childfree women 
Coz they are less in number 
So like wing girl sort of thing
6/21/24, 11:45 AM - Aishwarya: I think he understood that it was me who did that ,probably the girls told him ,idk
6/21/24, 11:46 AM - Aishwarya: And he probably felt that I'm a good friend 
It's just that I'm naturally a good friend to some people
6/21/24, 11:46 AM - Sayanth: Dude dude ik this might come off as rude but you are actually pretty and cute lol just look at that smile of urs . Yeah u have a darker skin tone (although id say its a good shade of tan) but u don't have to think of u as inferior or negative in anyway  cuz u aren't honestly u look pretty pretty ✨️ I'm not saying that to make u feel better but u genuinely do look pretty.
6/21/24, 11:47 AM - Aishwarya: But he was not a good friend to me 
And he wasn't doing the listener friend part even 
And kept invalidating my views etc
6/21/24, 11:47 AM - Sayanth: Yeah that I understood
6/21/24, 11:47 AM - Aishwarya: Thanks 
You are so sweet ☺️🥹😇
6/21/24, 11:49 AM - Aishwarya: And then he messaged me again after some months in April I think 
Saying he don't have friends who he vibe with ,something like that 

I think he liked the fact that I used to praise him a lot 
Which I don't mind 

But he was unnecessarily being a hater to me
6/21/24, 11:49 AM - Aishwarya: So in my mind I was like bye bye 😂
6/21/24, 11:51 AM - Sayanth: See if u like someone go for it don't let anything stop u . Some might be racist /colorist but u are truly a good person at least from my pov and u are pretty so I'd say don't think of ur self negatively
6/21/24, 11:52 AM - Sayanth: If they don't like u back their loss
6/21/24, 11:52 AM - Sayanth: Not urs it better to be not liked by bad people I'd say
6/21/24, 11:53 AM - Sayanth: Totally understandable
6/21/24, 11:53 AM - Sayanth: And d
6/21/24, 11:53 AM - Sayanth: What happened after that
6/21/24, 11:53 AM - Sayanth: ??
6/21/24, 11:53 AM - Aishwarya: Okay 
Thanks 
And especially thanks for saying I'm a good person 

Some people really don't understand my way of thinking
6/21/24, 11:54 AM - Aishwarya: I told him a nice way that he is a good person but not my vibe 

I feel like he is actually better than many guys I know 
Many guys especially from my college was much worse
6/21/24, 11:56 AM - Aishwarya: He knows about my main crush ,he is fat
6/21/24, 11:57 AM - Sayanth: Do u still have crush on him ?
6/21/24, 11:57 AM - Sayanth: I thought u said u lost that crush
6/21/24, 11:59 AM - Aishwarya: Oh but this guy doesn't know that the crush guy is fat
But I think he understood who the guy is 
Coz both are from the childfree community and living in bangalore
6/21/24, 11:59 AM - Sayanth: Oh ok
6/21/24, 12:01 PM - Aishwarya: Yea kind of 

I actually had a crush on another guy too 
( lowkey a crush)
I haven't even seen him 
But I like his ways of thinking 

Unlike the main crush ,he is kind of my skin tone 
But thats okay coz he is also ending his bloodline 
But then later I found out that he is not as serious about being childfree like I thought
6/21/24, 12:03 PM - Aishwarya: This guy follows like 7k girls on IG 
We became friends on reddit first ( from cfi ) 
Then whatsapp 
So later I took his insta 
And saw this 💀
I didn't expect that much ,like 7k ? 😂
6/21/24, 12:03 PM - Aishwarya: On whatsapp I told him that I'm not okay with certain behaviors in men ,that mainly includes body shaming 
( he is someone who is into 'dark humor')
6/21/24, 12:05 PM - Sayanth: Ah I see
6/21/24, 12:05 PM - Sayanth: 7k damn
6/21/24, 12:05 PM - Aishwarya: <Media omitted>
6/21/24, 12:05 PM - Aishwarya: Yea
6/21/24, 12:06 PM - Aishwarya: He literally said it's not okay in his pov
6/21/24, 12:13 PM - Sayanth: U there ?
6/21/24, 12:13 PM - Aishwarya: Then in February he sends me a reel, body shaming flat girls 
I'm kind of bisexual ,and I'm not really attracted to flat girls 
Even non fair girls not as much ; in guys I don't really have much physical preferences ,especially not in skin colour atleast 
But I think I have only liked two guys or so who are very dark ,so I think I generally don't like very dark guys 
My crushes till first year of college was always dusky range guys 
Later I became more selective, the pain of being heartbroken in certain case is much more for me
6/21/24, 12:13 PM - Aishwarya: Ya
6/21/24, 12:13 PM - Aishwarya: So like having preference is alright
6/21/24, 12:13 PM - Aishwarya: But shaming is not
6/21/24, 12:13 PM - Sayanth: Yeah of course it's not
6/21/24, 12:13 PM - Aishwarya: And then I went off on him ,for sending me that 😂
6/21/24, 12:15 PM - Aishwarya: I literally send some audio messages in english 😂
I was like will you be okay if someone send you a reel about some insecurity that you have 
And he kept asking ,why do you have flat chest, why are you so offended 
I don't, but I didn't tell him 
That's not the point
6/21/24, 12:16 PM - Aishwarya: He kept denying that he won't be okay with it
6/21/24, 12:16 PM - Aishwarya: I haven't seen him 
Just his hands 
He had posted some pic after he got some minor injury
6/21/24, 12:17 PM - Aishwarya: But I know from his reddit ,that he is bit chubby range 
But not fat I think 
So I told him ,I know what you are insecure about ,but I'm not gonna say coz I'm not like you
6/21/24, 12:19 PM - Aishwarya: And then few days later ,he had posted on whatsapp something 
It had his shirt size which had medium 😂
That was unnecessary 
Like that shows he cares about how I see him 
And how girls see him 
Which is valid
6/21/24, 12:19 PM - Sayanth: Hmm u gotta stop talking to them it's better to just stop wasting your energy on them
6/21/24, 12:21 PM - Sayanth: Some don't change
6/21/24, 12:22 PM - Aishwarya: Yea ,I'm no longer friends with him 
The friendship ended in February first week or so 
But he send me birthday wishes in March ,out of nowhere 
( I used to watch his IG stories still though)
And I had told him ,I still want to be acquitances ( back then, coz of his povs)
Which I don't mind , and that time I still didn't really dislike him coz I liked some of his views on childfree
6/21/24, 12:22 PM - Aishwarya: Yea true
6/21/24, 12:22 PM - Aishwarya: And I after I found out that,his views regarding childfree was not like I thought, I stopped watching his stories also
6/21/24, 12:25 PM - Aishwarya: I don't watch stories in general ,for no particular reason 
Depends on my energy level that day 
I just watch here and there
6/21/24, 12:25 PM - Sayanth: Oh
6/21/24, 12:28 PM - Aishwarya: Yea ,I mean stories of everyone 
Even my friends ,I don't sometimes watch stories
Sometimes I do 
But the reason is not related to them 
Just my energy levels 

But in his case, I completely stopped watching it ( I used to mostly watch his stories)
One reason is I wanted him to know that, I'm not okay with his point of views on childfree
6/21/24, 12:29 PM - Aishwarya: Coz that is something i liked about him ( he had multiple other red flags)

So that was also not there ,so I didn't like him as a person anymore
6/21/24, 12:33 PM - Aishwarya: Also , being childfree is not a necessity in my friends 
It's just a bonus 
The previous guy friend who I told about ,he was not childfree 
I think in your case you might be on the fence about it 
Which doesn't matter either ways
6/21/24, 12:37 PM - Aishwarya: And I used to always root for him 
Saying that he should focus on CAT exams to get to good college ,so that he can increase his odds of having good wife ,family etc 
And calling him cute lol 
He asked me to stop calling him that 😂
One reason I did it was because , I felt like he should also get something out of the friendship right 
He was helpful to me by being a good listener
6/21/24, 12:38 PM - Aishwarya: It's natural for people to lose interest in one sided things 
When they are the only one who is giving 
So I thought that might help the friendship
6/21/24, 12:39 PM - Aishwarya: And I think it did work 🤔
Coz why does he want to call me every ten days or so 
Even after I ghosted him at some point ( coz I found out some things about him ,his views, which he lied about )
6/21/24, 12:40 PM - Sayanth: Nah I really Really don't want kids
6/21/24, 12:41 PM - Sayanth: Oh like what
6/21/24, 12:41 PM - Sayanth: ?!
6/21/24, 12:41 PM - Aishwarya: Anyways I don't mind supporting him either ways 
There is only few things that certain guys can do which will make me annoyed 
And he did turn out to have that 
Even then I don't really dislike him 
But I don't really see him as a friend anymore 
Coz I feel he has some animosity towards me 
That he is lowkey a hater
6/21/24, 12:43 PM - Aishwarya: Oh okay 
But you are really young though 
And a guy 
Even me ,if I was a guy ,I would not be childfree probably 

Anyways good if you are , coz that's a rare quality
6/21/24, 12:44 PM - Aishwarya: The casteism thing 
Like he is too much into it 

I literally said its okay to marry within same caste 
( if it was me in his shoes ,I would do the same probably, so no judgments)
6/21/24, 12:45 PM - Aishwarya: But I dont dislike him though
Mostly indifferent 
I just don't see him as a friend anymore
6/21/24, 12:45 PM - Aishwarya: Coz this topic, I dont really care about it
6/21/24, 12:46 PM - Sayanth: Yeah that's understandable if someone wants have preferences I'm ok with it but enforcing it on someone else that's not something I can tolerate
6/21/24, 12:46 PM - Aishwarya: Yes true
6/21/24, 12:51 PM - Aishwarya: And something I respect about him is that he is not into hookups and severe objectification of girls 
Plus he offered support for some woman who was undergoing domestic violence 
And his ex gf who went through kind of a rape 
Usually some guys only care about things benefiting them 
Many guys in my college was like that
6/21/24, 12:53 PM - Aishwarya: But the red flag is that he believes in bringing back and having nostalgia of upper caste having dominance in society 
Sad that be had to be disappointing in that way 

But still better than the other kind of red flag guys ,in terms of how bad they are for society and women 
Coz those guys influence other guys too
6/21/24, 12:56 PM - Aishwarya: Coz the caste system is not gonna return anyways 
Plus in terms of people having caste preference in terms of marriage etc ,I don't really see anything wrong with it 
And many people are moving abroad, and there another division called race is there anyways
6/21/24, 12:58 PM - Aishwarya: But this is more problematic 
Such guys 
Example the 7k guy 
He posted on women's day that men's day is not celebrated much because men have way too much achievements 
I can't remember what it exactly was
6/21/24, 12:59 PM - Aishwarya: And there was some gender equality event one day in bangalore 
Kind of similar like pride month, people parading it 

This one was people running long kilometer to show support to gender equality
6/21/24, 1:00 PM - Aishwarya: And he posted something about see gender equality 
The men are supposed to run 10 km
And women 5 km 

Like dude 😂
That is not what gender equality is about
6/21/24, 1:01 PM - Aishwarya: But btw I'm not really into gender equality stuff either 
Coz I believe men and women are different 
Men have their own strong points
6/21/24, 1:03 PM - Aishwarya: And I feel without men ,the  developments we have till now will not be possible 
And men are biologically more strong than women 

Even though there are women who are willing to do all those jobs ,I don't think they will be as efficient
6/21/24, 1:04 PM - Aishwarya: But the point is ,he is simply being a hater 
Like what did women do to him 😂

If anything he should be feeling so towards men ,coz his own sister had to go through divorce coz of physical abuse from her husband
6/21/24, 1:05 PM - Sayanth: Oh that's bad
6/21/24, 1:05 PM - Aishwarya: Yea
6/21/24, 1:06 PM - Sayanth: Why he following that much girls then lol
6/21/24, 1:06 PM - Aishwarya: That is the reason I see men who are better than many other men, as gems
6/21/24, 1:06 PM - Aishwarya: Yea
That's what 💀😂
6/21/24, 1:07 PM - Aishwarya: I guess girls exist just for male gaze in his mind 
Like severe objectifying kind of guy
6/21/24, 1:09 PM - Aishwarya: But he seems like a guy who is into love stories 
But at the same time hating on women 
Which is another red flag 
Atleast some guys are self aware that they are not capable of 'love'
6/21/24, 1:12 PM - Aishwarya: There was once some conversation about love stories in movies and irl 
And I told I don't really see most cases as love ( just my opinion )
And he was saying about romeo and juliet and some other movies 
And titanic
6/21/24, 1:14 PM - Aishwarya: I told him that both of those stories are stupid in a realistic sense , coz in reality many couples are too far from 'love'
But as a movie it's good
6/21/24, 1:15 PM - Sayanth: Yeah ikr ik
6/21/24, 1:15 PM - Sayanth: Most of them are not realistic at all
6/21/24, 1:15 PM - Sayanth: Not even remotely
6/21/24, 1:17 PM - Aishwarya: But one of my friends from Delhi, she is very much into movies especially the romantic genre 
But in her case , atleast she is capable of that to a point 
Like a non toxic relationship atleast 

But not him ,he is not capable of even a healthy monogamous relationship imo
With his 7k girls and his views on women 😂
6/21/24, 1:17 PM - Aishwarya: Yea
6/21/24, 1:17 PM - Aishwarya: Yea 😂
6/21/24, 1:19 PM - Aishwarya: My crush, that guy ,he had told somewhere ,in a group actually 
About his parents relationship 
Being in love and stuff 
I think he probably believes so ,or was just flexing 
Or both
6/21/24, 1:21 PM - Aishwarya: Coz a lot of men think that ,men can cheat on their wife physically ,and still 'love' them 
Must be nice to be so delulu

Even I know that ,what I have is infatuation ,unhealthy unattachment etc 
Coz of the resentment I feel towards some men ,even though they are the ones who did me wrong directly or indirectly at first 
That is definitely not love 
Which I'm aware
6/21/24, 1:22 PM - Aishwarya: I found out that his dad is following some questionable girls 
Like the sex service ones
6/21/24, 1:22 PM - Aishwarya: And they follow him back
6/21/24, 1:24 PM - Aishwarya: His wife knows or not knows that idk 
But it's their relationship, so since even I could find it 
I think probably she knows 
As long as she is aware , it's not really morally wrong per say imo 
But sometimes women agree coz no other option
6/21/24, 1:24 PM - Aishwarya: But it's definitely not love imo
6/21/24, 1:25 PM - Aishwarya: But doesn't really matter coz not something effecting me 
But it was kind of disappointing though ,when I found out 💀😂
6/21/24, 1:50 PM - Sayanth: Now I feel bad for him lol
6/21/24, 1:51 PM - Sayanth: Poor dude
6/21/24, 4:55 PM - Aishwarya: Him means the crush guy right
6/21/24, 4:56 PM - Aishwarya: But I think he is the type of guy who is okay with it
6/21/24, 4:56 PM - Aishwarya: I remember some video long ago ,where andrew tate supports his dad's cheating
6/21/24, 4:58 PM - Aishwarya: Saying when he was a child ,he didn't like his dad cheating 
But later he understood that men have 'needs'

6/21/24, 5:31 PM - Aishwarya: I think the women who are financially dependent on their husband ,don't have that option to leave

6/22/24, 12:30 AM - Sayanth: It's kinda like self betrayal
6/22/24, 12:30 AM - Sayanth: At least to me

6/22/24, 10:26 PM - Aishwarya: Why ?
6/22/24, 10:26 PM - Aishwarya: Anything happened ?
6/22/24, 10:26 PM - Sayanth: Anxiety attacks
6/22/24, 10:26 PM - Aishwarya: Or just usual mood swings
6/22/24, 10:26 PM - Aishwarya: Oh
6/22/24, 10:26 PM - Aishwarya: Okay
6/22/24, 10:27 PM - Sayanth: Idk why but it wasn't letting me relax
6/22/24, 10:27 PM - Aishwarya: What does anxiety attack include for you ?
If it's personal you don't have to say 

Also , your parents are aware right ?
6/22/24, 10:27 PM - Aishwarya: Oh
6/22/24, 10:28 PM - Sayanth: Mom knows but she doesn't really understand it
6/22/24, 10:28 PM - Aishwarya: Oh
6/22/24, 10:28 PM - Sayanth: Feeling suffocating
6/22/24, 10:28 PM - Sayanth: Palpitations
6/22/24, 10:28 PM - Aishwarya: Oh
6/22/24, 10:29 PM - Sayanth: And restlessness + panic
6/22/24, 10:29 PM - Aishwarya: Oh
6/22/24, 10:29 PM - Aishwarya: Okay
6/22/24, 10:30 PM - Aishwarya: It's related to bpd right ?
6/22/24, 10:30 PM - Sayanth: Idk
6/22/24, 10:30 PM - Sayanth: Might be
6/22/24, 10:31 PM - Aishwarya: You have looked about bpd yourself on the internet right ?
That is important for managing it
6/22/24, 10:31 PM - Sayanth: Yeah
6/22/24, 10:31 PM - Sayanth: Usually I don't show it to others
6/22/24, 10:32 PM - Sayanth: Like if I feel anything I'd keep it to myself
6/22/24, 10:32 PM - Aishwarya: Oh ,the physical symptoms also right ?
Or the emotional one
6/22/24, 10:33 PM - Sayanth: Both
6/22/24, 10:33 PM - Sayanth: W8
6/22/24, 10:33 PM - Aishwarya: Also do you mind me asking about this ?
It can be personal 
I don't want to cross any boundaries
6/22/24, 10:33 PM - Aishwarya: Okay
6/22/24, 10:33 PM - Sayanth: Tell me if it's not comfortable for u
6/22/24, 10:33 PM - Sayanth: But
6/22/24, 10:33 PM - Sayanth: How's ur periods
6/22/24, 10:33 PM - Sayanth: ?
6/22/24, 10:34 PM - Sayanth: Do u get period cramps ?
6/22/24, 10:34 PM - Aishwarya: I don't mind at all 
I like the topics related to mental health actually
6/22/24, 10:34 PM - Aishwarya: Not really
6/22/24, 10:34 PM - Sayanth: Is the pain really bad for you
6/22/24, 10:34 PM - Sayanth: No it's ok
6/22/24, 10:35 PM - Aishwarya: Last few months ,the cramps was not there ,expect probably a few hours on the first day 
Like mild to moderate cramps
6/22/24, 10:35 PM - Sayanth: Also do u get mood swings as part of it
6/22/24, 10:35 PM - Sayanth: Oh
6/22/24, 10:35 PM - Aishwarya: But two years ago ,during once, I had more than moderate cramps ,it lasted for an hour or so 
It was painful kind of 
But tolerable
6/22/24, 10:38 PM - Aishwarya: Not really 
In the sense not more than the other days 

But I don't feel as fresh as on other days coz the blood is there 
And more tired and less hungry ( on the first two days)
Oh and diarrhea once or so on the first day lol
6/22/24, 10:39 PM - Aishwarya: Not on all months ,but sometimes
6/22/24, 10:40 PM - Sayanth: Oh
6/22/24, 10:40 PM - Aishwarya: Ya
6/22/24, 10:41 PM - Sayanth: So how would you want others to act during that time ?
6/22/24, 10:41 PM - Sayanth: Be honest
6/22/24, 10:42 PM - Aishwarya: Not anything particular 
I don't usually interact with people with anyways 

But during college times, there was no way I want anyone to act haha 
I think I would be tired ,so I don't hangout with friends those days usually
6/22/24, 10:43 PM - Aishwarya: But I remember my bro telling me that his gf has mood swings on those days 
And she gets bit angry ig
6/22/24, 10:43 PM - Sayanth: Relatable
6/22/24, 10:43 PM - Aishwarya: Oh 😂
6/22/24, 10:43 PM - Aishwarya: What happened?
6/22/24, 10:43 PM - Aishwarya: Did any girl behave some sort of way ?
6/22/24, 10:43 PM - Sayanth: Not gf but mom
6/22/24, 10:44 PM - Aishwarya: Ohh
6/22/24, 10:44 PM - Sayanth: She gets real angry
6/22/24, 10:44 PM - Sayanth: Yeah there was this girl in 12th grade who had crush on me
6/22/24, 10:44 PM - Sayanth: She was kinda obsessed so she had these extreme mood swings as well
6/22/24, 10:44 PM - Sayanth: She would stop talking to me and stop replying
6/22/24, 10:45 PM - Aishwarya: My mom I remember she used to do housework on her period days as well 😑
Like even cleaning with mop sometimes 
I have heard once mom telling to dad about it 
That she also works 
Poor her 😕
6/22/24, 10:45 PM - Sayanth: And when I ask she will be like nah nothing
6/22/24, 10:46 PM - Aishwarya: Oh that's bad 

I mean people always have control over how they react, to a point 
Emotions are not that controllable but acting on it is controllable
6/22/24, 10:46 PM - Aishwarya: For no reason ?
6/22/24, 10:46 PM - Sayanth: Yeah that I understand my mom says the same although she doesn't get cramps she gets backpain at that time
6/22/24, 10:46 PM - Aishwarya: Okay
6/22/24, 10:46 PM - Aishwarya: Oh
6/22/24, 10:46 PM - Sayanth: She'll find something
6/22/24, 10:46 PM - Aishwarya: Oh
6/22/24, 10:46 PM - Sayanth: Like it could be anything could be something we say
6/22/24, 10:47 PM - Aishwarya: Oh
6/22/24, 10:47 PM - Aishwarya: Hm got it
6/22/24, 10:47 PM - Aishwarya: Okay 
Understood
6/22/24, 10:47 PM - Aishwarya: Oh okay
6/22/24, 10:48 PM - Sayanth: Then I'll think it'd better to leave her alone for sometime cuz she's angry but then she'll text me why am I not talking to her , and would say that I'm ignoring her and all
6/22/24, 10:48 PM - Sayanth: We weren't even in a relationship
6/22/24, 10:48 PM - Aishwarya: But why do you care though ?
( it is coz of bpd )?

Coz you don't like her right ?
6/22/24, 10:49 PM - Sayanth: She once gave me 2 five stars
6/22/24, 10:49 PM - Sayanth: So idk I've a soft corner for her
6/22/24, 10:49 PM - Sayanth: Not romantically
6/22/24, 10:49 PM - Sayanth: But she's a friend
6/22/24, 10:49 PM - Sayanth: So that's it
6/22/24, 10:50 PM - Aishwarya: In my case ,I did care about what the other person think ,even if they are the one in the wrong ,when it was my main friend at the time 

Coz if they drop me ,I will have to sit alone 

But whenever that happened  ,I always got another friend though 
This happened like twice in college lol ,friendship drama
6/22/24, 10:51 PM - Sayanth: In. Case if there's anything u want me to change just be brutally honest ok I'll
6/22/24, 10:52 PM - Aishwarya: Oh 
I can't relate 

The only time I think about what the other person think of me , is in terms of looks 
But mainly if it's my crush though 
But ig mostly everyone is like that ,unless they are clearly attractive and aware of it 
But even such people get insecure ,if the person they like other people who are better looking etc
6/22/24, 10:53 PM - Aishwarya: Once my crush left me on read 
And I had triple texted him
That time I did care 

And I remember forcing a conversation with another crush too
Like me trying to explain my part lol 
Coz I did something wrong ,not wrong but in his pov it was
6/22/24, 10:54 PM - Sayanth: Yeah totally relatable
6/22/24, 10:54 PM - Sayanth: I do that too often
6/22/24, 10:55 PM - Aishwarya: I think you are good enough person 
Athrem okke mathi 
Overly good aayaal people gonna take advantage 
And I think you need to cut off people who are one sided friendships 
Since you are in college now , no need to cut anyone like that out from college though ,till college ends
6/22/24, 10:56 PM - Aishwarya: Ohhh
6/22/24, 10:56 PM - Aishwarya: When did it last happen?
6/22/24, 10:56 PM - Sayanth: Well I guess last day
6/22/24, 10:56 PM - Aishwarya: Oh yesterday ?
6/22/24, 10:57 PM - Aishwarya: What happened?
6/22/24, 10:57 PM - Sayanth: Nah nothing particular
6/22/24, 10:57 PM - Aishwarya: Is that person good to you 
If not what are you worried about 
Why does it matter if they leave you or not
6/22/24, 10:58 PM - Sayanth: Just texted someone and they left me on seen so I got anxious
6/22/24, 10:58 PM - Sayanth: And then texted again
6/22/24, 10:58 PM - Aishwarya: Oh I thought 
It's related to double texting
6/22/24, 10:58 PM - Sayanth: Twice
6/22/24, 10:58 PM - Aishwarya: Ohh
6/22/24, 10:59 PM - Aishwarya: If it's related to dating , I think it's natural ,to a point 

If it's close friend also, it's natural
6/22/24, 10:59 PM - Sayanth: Yeah she's that's why she's actually kinda good to me + we have same music taste so I guess that's the reason
6/22/24, 10:59 PM - Aishwarya: Coz people want that in their life 
So it's only natural they get worried
6/22/24, 11:00 PM - Aishwarya: Oh okay
6/22/24, 11:00 PM - Aishwarya: How do you know if they left you on read though 
Was there the blue tick kind of thing ? Or anything like that which indicates it ?
6/22/24, 11:00 PM - Sayanth: Yess insta
6/22/24, 11:01 PM - Sayanth: It showed it was seen
6/22/24, 11:01 PM - Aishwarya: Also ,they did you communicate with her that you get anxious when she leave you on read ?
6/22/24, 11:01 PM - Sayanth: BTW why did u turn off that
6/22/24, 11:01 PM - Sayanth: Read receipts
6/22/24, 11:01 PM - Aishwarya: I think you have to communicate this 
Girls are pretty understanding
6/22/24, 11:01 PM - Sayanth: Nope
6/22/24, 11:02 PM - Aishwarya: Especially since you said she is kinda good 
So she will understand
6/22/24, 11:02 PM - Sayanth: Yeah but I think I might be having a hugeee crush on her
6/22/24, 11:02 PM - Aishwarya: On whatsapp it is turned off
6/22/24, 11:03 PM - Sayanth: And I don't think I'll ever get to be with her so I think it's better if we stay at a distance
6/22/24, 11:03 PM - Sayanth: Not to get too close
6/22/24, 11:03 PM - Sayanth: I don't want to get attached and get my heart broke again
6/22/24, 11:03 PM - Aishwarya: That's coz I don't want some people seeing that I viewed their whatsapp status 😂

Like I'm not really in contact with some of them ,coz of time plus other reasons
6/22/24, 11:04 PM - Aishwarya: Oh okay
6/22/24, 11:04 PM - Sayanth: Oh understandable
6/22/24, 11:05 PM - Aishwarya: Yes that's a possibility 
Depending on what you want from life 

Sometimes some people are worth some pain 
To experience happiness and life , sometimes have to take risks
6/22/24, 11:05 PM - Aishwarya: Ya
6/22/24, 11:05 PM - Sayanth: Well yeah
6/22/24, 11:05 PM - Sayanth: I guess I should
6/22/24, 11:05 PM - Aishwarya: Ya
6/22/24, 11:06 PM - Aishwarya: She is from your same district right ?
6/22/24, 11:06 PM - Sayanth: No no
6/22/24, 11:06 PM - Aishwarya: Oh
6/22/24, 11:06 PM - Aishwarya: Then isn't it kind of waste of time
6/22/24, 11:06 PM - Sayanth: We are just friends
6/22/24, 11:06 PM - Sayanth: More like close friend
6/22/24, 11:07 PM - Sayanth: Nothing romantic
6/22/24, 11:07 PM - Aishwarya: Oh but you said you have crush on her right
6/22/24, 11:07 PM - Sayanth: But she's good friend
6/22/24, 11:07 PM - Aishwarya: So you probably might want to get into relationship with her right ?
Or date her
6/22/24, 11:07 PM - Sayanth: Crush is from kollam
6/22/24, 11:07 PM - Aishwarya: Oh
6/22/24, 11:08 PM - Sayanth: This girl helped my find my first psychiatrist
6/22/24, 11:08 PM - Aishwarya: Oh I meant that long distance relationships usually work
6/22/24, 11:08 PM - Sayanth: That's how we connected
6/22/24, 11:08 PM - Aishwarya: And you guys won't be able to meet often also
6/22/24, 11:08 PM - Aishwarya: Okay
6/22/24, 11:08 PM - Aishwarya: That's good
6/22/24, 11:09 PM - Sayanth: Yeah
6/22/24, 11:09 PM - Sayanth: Also fun fact I don't even know her name
6/22/24, 11:09 PM - Sayanth: I've not seen her
6/22/24, 11:09 PM - Aishwarya: Oh I remember now

If you are comfortable can you share a pic of yours 
Something like that
6/22/24, 11:13 PM - Sayanth: Hmm yeah

6/22/24, 11:21 PM - Aishwarya: It's the same ,but without the chilly powder 
Can eat a lot more of it coz it has way less chilli powder

6/22/24, 11:23 PM - Aishwarya: I like red fish curry and rice 
But I don't usually eat it much though 
Coz one reason is it doesn't have much nutrition
6/22/24, 11:25 PM - Sayanth: Yeah yeah
6/22/24, 11:26 PM - Sayanth: I'm trying to reduce my rice intake
6/22/24, 11:26 PM - Aishwarya: Nissin Hot & Spicy Korean Chicken Flavour Pouch, 80g (pack of 4) Unique| https://amzn.in/d/0gt6w2VW

6/22/24, 11:26 PM - Aishwarya: Okay
6/22/24, 11:26 PM - Sayanth: I don't even like other flavors of maggi
6/22/24, 11:27 PM - Sayanth: I tried some like top Ramen, and yippie and some other flavors of Maggi but idk I didn't like any of those

6/22/24, 11:29 PM - Aishwarya: Just to try
6/22/24, 11:29 PM - Aishwarya: I think most of Maggie's taste is from its masala
6/22/24, 11:30 PM - Sayanth: Yessss
6/22/24, 11:30 PM - Sayanth: Of course it's the masala
6/22/24, 11:30 PM - Aishwarya: Ya
6/22/24, 11:30 PM - Aishwarya: I think the flour used is maida right
6/22/24, 11:30 PM - Sayanth: Also did u know earlier they used to add lead in it
6/22/24, 11:30 PM - Sayanth: Yeah I think so
6/22/24, 11:30 PM - Aishwarya: Hm not surprising 
Edak ban aakiyath alle maggi
6/22/24, 11:31 PM - Sayanth: Yup

6/22/24, 11:32 PM - Sayanth: Officially angane aan
6/22/24, 11:32 PM - Aishwarya: Why did they add lead ?
6/22/24, 11:32 PM - Aishwarya: By mistake
6/22/24, 11:32 PM - Sayanth: Pnne it mostly affects young children who's brains are in developmental stage
6/22/24, 11:32 PM - Aishwarya: Was the lead in the masala of the Maggie?
6/22/24, 11:32 PM - Aishwarya: Oh okay
6/22/24, 11:32 PM - Aishwarya: Yea
6/22/24, 11:33 PM - Sayanth: Idk 🤷‍♀️
6/22/24, 11:33 PM - Aishwarya: Okay hehe
6/22/24, 11:33 PM - Sayanth: Yeah probably it might be costly to filter out the lead particles
6/22/24, 11:33 PM - Sayanth: So they just kinda ignored it
6/22/24, 11:34 PM - Aishwarya: Oh
6/22/24, 11:34 PM - Aishwarya: Btw this is a girl haha
6/22/24, 11:34 PM - Aishwarya: Oh okay
6/22/24, 11:34 PM - Sayanth: Yeah ik lol I always use that girl one for some reason

6/22/24, 11:35 PM - Sayanth: I guess
6/22/24, 11:35 PM - Aishwarya: Oh
6/22/24, 11:35 PM - Sayanth: 🤷🏼
6/22/24, 11:35 PM - Sayanth: This
6/22/24, 11:35 PM - Sayanth: He's gender fluid
6/22/24, 11:35 PM - Aishwarya: 🫃what is this lol 💀
6/22/24, 11:36 PM - Aishwarya: I mean no offense to any genders 😅
6/22/24, 11:36 PM - Sayanth: Yeah that's what I'm talking about
6/22/24, 11:36 PM - Aishwarya: Oh 
Didnt know
6/22/24, 11:36 PM - Sayanth: Tbh that's pretty scientifically inaccurate
6/22/24, 11:36 PM - Aishwarya: Ya 😂
6/22/24, 11:37 PM - Sayanth: No offense if someone wanna live in a different way than other sure that's entirely upto them but this is pure bs
6/22/24, 11:37 PM - Sayanth: Like men can get pregnant
6/22/24, 11:37 PM - Aishwarya: Yea 😂
6/22/24, 11:48 PM - Sayanth: <Media omitted>
6/22/24, 11:48 PM - Sayanth: This makes sense
6/22/24, 11:49 PM - Aishwarya: I didn't understand the meaning
6/22/24, 11:49 PM - Sayanth: Forward
6/22/24, 11:49 PM - Sayanth: Backward
6/22/24, 11:49 PM - Sayanth: So cow-ard
6/22/24, 11:50 PM - Aishwarya: Oh
6/22/24, 11:50 PM - Sayanth: Should be the direction towards cow
6/22/24, 11:50 PM - Aishwarya: But how does it make sense though
6/22/24, 11:50 PM - Aishwarya: I think I kind of get the joke btw
6/22/24, 11:51 PM - Sayanth: Yeah yeah it's as a joke makes sense
6/22/24, 11:51 PM - Aishwarya: Because cow doesn't move in any particular direction right
6/22/24, 11:51 PM - Aishwarya: Oh okay haha
6/22/24, 11:51 PM - Aishwarya: Got it

6/23/24, 12:07 AM - Sayanth: That's kinda a condition tbh
6/23/24, 12:08 AM - Aishwarya: That's a caste right 
And they have some customs I think
6/23/24, 12:08 AM - Sayanth: She doesn't watch live action movies cuz she thinks everyone who watches those are kinda perverts
6/23/24, 12:08 AM - Sayanth: And bad

Severe brainwashing
6/23/24, 12:09 AM - Sayanth: Yup
6/23/24, 12:09 AM - Sayanth: But that's not the funny part
6/23/24, 12:09 AM - Sayanth: She watches porn
6/23/24, 12:09 AM - Aishwarya: Only to probably get married to a guy watches porn on the regular 💀🤣
6/23/24, 12:09 AM - Aishwarya: Oh
6/23/24, 12:09 AM - Aishwarya: Then why
6/23/24, 12:09 AM - Aishwarya: She has that belief
6/23/24, 12:10 AM - Aishwarya: I mean nothing wrong in that
6/23/24, 12:10 AM - Sayanth: And describes those things to me also she wasn't 18 at that time like barely 18
6/23/24, 12:10 AM - Sayanth: So i was shit scared of that
6/23/24, 12:11 AM - Aishwarya: Ohhh
6/23/24, 12:11 AM - Sayanth: It's fine if she wanna watch it but talking about it to me while she's not 18 and I'm
6/23/24, 12:11 AM - Sayanth: That could land me in prison
6/23/24, 12:11 AM - Sayanth: Yeah prolly
6/23/24, 12:12 AM - Sayanth: They won't marry out of their group
6/23/24, 12:12 AM - Aishwarya: Ohh 
I forgot that part 
Is it an Indian law thing ?

In liberal countries its not like that right ?
6/23/24, 12:12 AM - Sayanth: Idk it's kinda full of self contradictions
6/23/24, 12:12 AM - Aishwarya: Oh
6/23/24, 12:12 AM - Sayanth: Yeah
6/23/24, 12:13 AM - Sayanth: Pocso
6/23/24, 12:13 AM - Aishwarya: Yea
6/23/24, 12:13 AM - Aishwarya: Oh btw I got reminded of something
6/23/24, 12:13 AM - Sayanth: Oh what
6/23/24, 12:13 AM - Aishwarya: That reels girl
I think that guy got arrested
6/23/24, 12:14 AM - Sayanth: Who
6/23/24, 12:14 AM - Aishwarya: I feel like she also consented to it 
Coz otherwise why she went to resort many times with him
6/23/24, 12:14 AM - Sayanth: Oh ok got it
6/23/24, 12:14 AM - Aishwarya: The girl who suicided
6/23/24, 12:15 AM - Sayanth: It's prolly that
6/23/24, 12:15 AM - Aishwarya: I think the guy got arrested coz of the age thing also 
She is 18 or less
6/23/24, 12:15 AM - Sayanth: She was 18 I think
6/23/24, 12:15 AM - Aishwarya: Okay
6/23/24, 12:15 AM - Aishwarya: Yea 18 or almost I read
6/23/24, 12:15 AM - Aishwarya: Probably already 18
6/23/24, 12:15 AM - Sayanth: But since it's a suicide and her family is accusing him yeah that's prolly why
6/23/24, 12:16 AM - Aishwarya: Yea
6/23/24, 12:16 AM - Aishwarya: Okay back to that story 
I think you should block her
6/23/24, 12:16 AM - Sayanth: They should have handled it like mature people
6/23/24, 12:16 AM - Aishwarya: Yea
6/23/24, 12:16 AM - Sayanth: I had
6/23/24, 12:16 AM - Aishwarya: Okay then
6/23/24, 12:16 AM - Sayanth: She'll just make another account
6/23/24, 12:16 AM - Aishwarya: Oh
6/23/24, 12:17 AM - Sayanth: So I told I'll be friends with her I had to
6/23/24, 12:17 AM - Aishwarya: Which year you both became friends?
6/23/24, 12:17 AM - Aishwarya: Like how long ago ?
6/23/24, 12:17 AM - Sayanth: Well we were in same school 12th
6/23/24, 12:17 AM - Sayanth: 2019
6/23/24, 12:17 AM - Sayanth: I guess
6/23/24, 12:18 AM - Aishwarya: Okay
6/23/24, 12:19 AM - Aishwarya: I think it will create some drama 
Or can land you in some trouble 

Usually it's guys who cause troubles to girls they are obsessed with or have crush on and it's not reciprocated
6/23/24, 12:19 AM - Aishwarya: But girls also 
Possibility is there
6/23/24, 12:19 AM - Aishwarya: So I think better to block any new accounts of her
6/23/24, 12:19 AM - Sayanth: Yeah she does that drama thing sometimes
6/23/24, 12:20 AM - Sayanth: Then she will make another account
6/23/24, 12:20 AM - Sayanth: No escape from her
6/23/24, 12:20 AM - Aishwarya: Oh
6/23/24, 12:20 AM - Sayanth: It kinda works tho
6/23/24, 12:20 AM - Aishwarya: Has she ever stalked you irl ?
6/23/24, 12:21 AM - Sayanth: Nope
6/23/24, 12:21 AM - Aishwarya: Oh how ?
6/23/24, 12:21 AM - Sayanth: I don't go out
6/23/24, 12:21 AM - Sayanth: So no
6/23/24, 12:21 AM - Aishwarya: You go to college and back to home right
6/23/24, 12:21 AM - Sayanth: She sends some reel weekly so all I've to do is react to it
6/23/24, 12:21 AM - Sayanth: It'll keep her calm
6/23/24, 12:21 AM - Aishwarya: Oh 😂
6/23/24, 12:21 AM - Aishwarya: Okay
6/23/24, 12:22 AM - Sayanth: Yeah we have college bus
6/23/24, 12:22 AM - Aishwarya: It's giving psycho 💀
I have never seen girls who are like this 
Except on reddit stories ig
6/23/24, 12:22 AM - Aishwarya: Something is off
6/23/24, 12:22 AM - Aishwarya: Okay
6/23/24, 12:23 AM - Sayanth: Well I never thought I'd see a girl who doesn't watch live action movies
6/23/24, 12:24 AM - Aishwarya: Okay imagine this 
You won't be able to keep with this right , reacting weekly to some reel
So I think better to cut off early
6/23/24, 12:25 AM - Aishwarya: And what if one day you have to completely cut her off 
And you do it much later
I think better to it now ,she seems immature and a psycho
6/23/24, 12:26 AM - Aishwarya: And she might stalk you irl too
6/23/24, 12:26 AM - Aishwarya: Better to make her remove contacts with you online too 
From what you said
6/23/24, 12:26 AM - Sayanth: Yeah she'll move to idukki  soon so I'm gonna block her after that
6/23/24, 12:27 AM - Aishwarya: Okay then
6/23/24, 12:30 AM - Aishwarya: Is there anyone else like this ?
That you don't want to keep contacts with, but you couldn't block or cut contacts
6/23/24, 12:30 AM - Sayanth: What do u call a bee that lives in America
6/23/24, 12:30 AM - Aishwarya: Coz time is precious

6/23/24, 12:43 AM - Aishwarya: And I didn't like him after he broke up with neethu
6/23/24, 12:44 AM - Aishwarya: Neethu is my friends friend 
I don't know her though
6/23/24, 12:44 AM - Sayanth: Oh
6/23/24, 12:44 AM - Aishwarya: Sanju inde license poyi I think ,forever 💀
6/23/24, 12:44 AM - Sayanth: I didn't watch till that
6/23/24, 12:44 AM - Sayanth: Yeah  heard the news
6/23/24, 12:45 AM - Aishwarya: And I heard that girl is older than him 
Plus she had married before 
Not sure though 
Plus that she had multiple relationships in past 
Idk if it's people hating in comments though
6/23/24, 12:45 AM - Aishwarya: Neethu is typical pavam kind of girl ,loyal kind
6/23/24, 12:46 AM - Sayanth: Prolly people hating I guess
6/23/24, 12:46 AM - Sayanth: Why did they break up tho
6/23/24, 12:46 AM - Aishwarya: But sanju karanam aanu neethu nu reach kitye 
As a side effect 
I think he left her for a better looking girl once he made money
6/23/24, 12:46 AM - Sayanth: Ohh
6/23/24, 12:46 AM - Aishwarya: I think it's probably a case of him leaving her for a better looking girl
6/23/24, 12:48 AM - Aishwarya: But orale matram kuttam parayan pattilla
During some reality show guest time ,neethu told that ' enik usually ithupola thadi ulla chekkanmare onum ishtam alla'
Something like that 
Plus sanju korch purake nadanita neethu yes paranje 
And I think she said clear yes after his YouTube became bit famous ( starting stage)
6/23/24, 12:49 AM - Aishwarya: But I feel like many girls are like that
6/23/24, 12:49 AM - Aishwarya: But atleast she is the loyal type
6/23/24, 12:49 AM - Sayanth: Oh what does she do

But still nalla close aayit ulla videos ,even lowkey dance types 
Pine going to hotel together, going to marine drive etc etc

6/23/24, 1:01 AM - Aishwarya: It will give closure about narcissistic behavior of some people
6/23/24, 1:01 AM - Aishwarya: Like to detect and avoid patterns

6/23/24, 1:08 AM - Aishwarya: This one ,I have only watched one video related to how to do mindfulness ,that one was good 
But other videos seem too long ,so idk if it's waste of time 
I no longer watch long videos
6/23/24, 1:08 AM - Sayanth: Oh it's ok it seems like a good channel tho
6/23/24, 1:08 AM - Aishwarya: Okay
6/23/24, 1:09 AM - Aishwarya: Related to what I didnt understand 
The ones I already told 
And yea many more traumatic events haha
6/23/24, 1:10 AM - Sayanth: Like did something else happen
6/23/24, 1:11 AM - Sayanth: Or did u talk to someone
6/23/24, 1:12 AM - Aishwarya: Few different category of traumas und 
But I have mostly moved on though ,from most atleast
6/23/24, 1:12 AM - Sayanth: Oh glad u moved on
6/23/24, 1:13 AM - Aishwarya: Oh yes 
I used to talk on call with that guy friend 
That actually helped 
I had read that vocalizing things helps clear mind 

Pinne therapy sessions ,total around 20
But for me, I felt like it just helped me coz they listened to me 
Idk if the experience is different with trauma informed therapists
6/23/24, 1:14 AM - Sayanth: Well either way u feel better that counts
6/23/24, 1:14 AM - Aishwarya: Yea
6/23/24, 1:15 AM - Aishwarya: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1aXykt1vLPDGTdm1KosIyhZdwb1rloUBaeptHJRvyjrc/edit?usp=drivesdk
6/23/24, 1:16 AM - Sayanth: Where did u get this
6/23/24, 1:16 AM - Aishwarya: One of my friends shared it with me
6/23/24, 1:17 AM - Sayanth: Oh
6/23/24, 1:17 AM - Aishwarya: Ya
6/23/24, 1:17 AM - Sayanth: Did u try any of them
6/23/24, 1:17 AM - Aishwarya: I haven't
6/23/24, 1:18 AM - Aishwarya: You can check it and maybe try them
6/23/24, 1:18 AM - Aishwarya: Especially if you find someone with lesser fees
6/23/24, 1:18 AM - Aishwarya: And better experience or certification
6/23/24, 1:19 AM - Aishwarya: You can check their psychology degree on LinkedIn ,from their name
6/23/24, 1:19 AM - Aishwarya: And if you chose to take therapy from any of the therapist, you can ask for the degree certificate, just to be sure 
In their profession ,the clients can ask for it 
I had asked for it
6/23/24, 1:20 AM - Sayanth: Yess I checked they have a list of Malayalam speaking therapists as well
6/23/24, 1:20 AM - Aishwarya: Ya
6/23/24, 1:20 AM - Sayanth: Oh
6/23/24, 1:20 AM - Aishwarya: Oh malayalam speaking other therapists, I had written down somewhere 
I will check and tell 
Like outside of this list
6/23/24, 1:21 AM - Aishwarya: But it's very less in number though
6/23/24, 1:21 AM - Sayanth: Sure thanks
6/23/24, 1:22 AM - Aishwarya: I had read somewhere that better to opt for therapist who are atleast 35 less 
Or 30 less
In age 
Coz the older ones tend to boomer like mindset ,mostly
6/23/24, 1:22 AM - Aishwarya: And also opting for ones from city like places also help
6/23/24, 1:23 AM - Aishwarya: But city like places, the fees tend to be higher though
6/23/24, 1:23 AM - Sayanth: Yeah I was scared that my psychiatrist might be a boomer fortunately he wasn't
6/23/24, 1:23 AM - Aishwarya: One reason is they have more exposure 
Plus their way of thinking is more open minded
6/23/24, 1:23 AM - Aishwarya: Oh 
How old is he?
6/23/24, 1:24 AM - Sayanth: https://open.spotify.com/track/2qY23y7WpSBDF1oXUkJcOR?si=5L2LaLzFQAGWP56RtGQWqw

6/23/24, 1:24 AM - Sayanth: Must be above 40
6/23/24, 1:24 AM - Aishwarya: Oh okay

6/23/24, 1:25 AM - Aishwarya: For therapist
6/23/24, 1:26 AM - Sayanth: She's my psychiatrist I need to find another therapist I guess I'll have to check the therapy centre they have another female therapist else I'll need thst list
6/23/24, 1:26 AM - Sayanth: I think for therapy mother tongue would be better
6/23/24, 1:26 AM - Aishwarya: Coz then lot of people will be available, lesser fees etc 
But it depends
6/23/24, 1:26 AM - Aishwarya: Okay
6/23/24, 1:26 AM - Aishwarya: Oh okay
6/23/24, 1:26 AM - Sayanth: Easier to express feeling and emotions

6/24/24, 12:01 AM - Aishwarya: Lol 💀
6/24/24, 12:01 AM - Aishwarya: Oh ,anything particular happened today ?
What's the reason
6/24/24, 12:01 AM - Sayanth: No idk tbh
6/24/24, 12:02 AM - Sayanth: It's just I've no idea
6/24/24, 12:02 AM - Sayanth: May be its cuz im finally having feelings for someone
6/24/24, 12:02 AM - Aishwarya: Oh
6/24/24, 12:02 AM - Aishwarya: Getting to the root cause is important, to manage it
6/24/24, 12:02 AM - Sayanth: I've always had attachment issues
6/24/24, 12:03 AM - Aishwarya: Oh
6/24/24, 12:03 AM - Sayanth: It could be a reason
6/24/24, 12:03 AM - Sayanth: I'm always scared of losing everyone close to me
6/24/24, 12:03 AM - Aishwarya: What about it is making you anxious 
Also did you ask her for the pic ? She right?
6/24/24, 12:03 AM - Aishwarya: Okay
6/24/24, 12:04 AM - Aishwarya: Oh 
It's normal to feel that 
But yea in your case it's more I think 
Probably coz of bpd 
Is your bpd related to parental neglect ?
6/24/24, 12:04 AM - Sayanth: No I didn't I think it'd be better if she just naturally gives it to me
6/24/24, 12:05 AM - Sayanth: Yup
6/24/24, 12:05 AM - Sayanth: Did I tell u about my mom putting 🌶 in my eyes
6/24/24, 12:06 AM - Aishwarya: That would never happen then 😅
Girls usually don't send pics just like that ,it will come across as being desperate 

You will have to ask her
6/24/24, 12:06 AM - Aishwarya: Wtf 😕
6/24/24, 12:06 AM - Sayanth: And Dad has always been dismissive
6/24/24, 12:06 AM - Sayanth: Yeah she did that once I was in 2nd grade
6/24/24, 12:07 AM - Aishwarya: No 
Why she did that 
And what happened before and after?
6/24/24, 12:07 AM - Sayanth: Well according to her I wasn't studying Well
6/24/24, 12:08 AM - Sayanth: But I was literally the topper
6/24/24, 12:08 AM - Aishwarya: Oh 😑
I have gotten beaten with belt and my dad broken a plastic chair 
He had hit me with that 

But I had thrown stuff in home to ,as revenge 
And I told I will inform police if he beats me again 
He probably beat me like 5 times or so total
6/24/24, 12:08 AM - Aishwarya: Oh
6/24/24, 12:09 AM - Aishwarya: Ohh
I was topper upto 3 rd too ,in my class 
Atleast first 3 in school
6/24/24, 12:09 AM - Aishwarya: Btw you were topper upto which grades
6/24/24, 12:09 AM - Sayanth: 8th
6/24/24, 12:10 AM - Aishwarya: But my parents never beat me for studies though 
Vocally they did say stuff, but I think that's pretty common in Indian households 
Pressure for studies
6/24/24, 12:10 AM - Aishwarya: Oh nice 🫡
6/24/24, 12:11 AM - Sayanth: Then from on 9th grade we were divided into different divisions based on our marks so I was in 9A which was full of toppers
6/24/24, 12:11 AM - Sayanth: Then 10th A
6/24/24, 12:11 AM - Aishwarya: Okay
6/24/24, 12:11 AM - Sayanth: Same story
6/24/24, 12:11 AM - Sayanth: Oh
6/24/24, 12:11 AM - Sayanth: Then what was that for
6/24/24, 12:13 AM - Aishwarya: Yea ,the last was because I was watching something on TV 
English song
And it had some half nudity ig 
And he said something I didn't like 
Can't remember exactly what 
Like why I'm watching this sort of stuff ,I should be studying 
I was just going to eat dinner that time 
And I talked to him back 
That's how the fight started
6/24/24, 12:14 AM - Sayanth: Oh
6/24/24, 12:15 AM - Aishwarya: After that I told ,if he ever beats me or anything I will go and tell police 

And also I went outside the home and started talking loudly about him 
So that neighbors can hear and it will be embarrassing for him 

Idc coz those people didn't know me ,I cared only about if my college people know coz I don't want that lol
6/24/24, 12:16 AM - Aishwarya: And later in therapy , coz the licensed therapist told him and mom that how he behave is traumatic to kids ,they took what they did more carefully
6/24/24, 12:16 AM - Sayanth: W8 this happened when you were in college
6/24/24, 12:17 AM - Aishwarya: And I actively kept distance from him mentally and physically 
Coz I don't like fighting 
But once someone do something, I also fight back
6/24/24, 12:17 AM - Aishwarya: During vacation
6/24/24, 12:18 AM - Aishwarya: In 2020
6/24/24, 12:18 AM - Sayanth: How old were u
6/24/24, 12:18 AM - Sayanth: 24
6/24/24, 12:18 AM - Sayanth: !
6/24/24, 12:18 AM - Aishwarya: I think 25
6/24/24, 12:18 AM - Aishwarya: Coz now I'm 29
6/24/24, 12:19 AM - Aishwarya: Why ,you didn't do anything back ?
6/24/24, 12:19 AM - Sayanth: I was in 2nd grade
6/24/24, 12:19 AM - Sayanth: Too young
6/24/24, 12:19 AM - Aishwarya: Yea some parents I guess, escalate more if the kid fight back
6/24/24, 12:19 AM - Aishwarya: And in my case ,mom is kind of supportive 
Even though for her dad comes first
6/24/24, 12:19 AM - Aishwarya: Okay
6/24/24, 12:20 AM - Sayanth: At that time I really believed I deserved that
6/24/24, 12:20 AM - Aishwarya: Before that he beat me with belt in 2017
6/24/24, 12:20 AM - Sayanth: Tbh till recent years that's  what I thought
6/24/24, 12:20 AM - Aishwarya: Before that I can't remember, probably like 3 more times ,when I was in school
6/24/24, 12:20 AM - Sayanth: Why was that
6/24/24, 12:21 AM - Aishwarya: I had light in my room at 3am lol 
Actually I was just watching YouTube 
It was another vacation time
6/24/24, 12:22 AM - Sayanth: Damn wtf
6/24/24, 12:22 AM - Aishwarya: But I literally caught him with something in his phone in 2020 
So I always bring it up 
If he tries to moral police me
6/24/24, 12:22 AM - Sayanth: That's not even a reason
6/24/24, 12:23 AM - Sayanth: Oh
6/24/24, 12:23 AM - Aishwarya: I actually had opportunity to do stuff, but I didn't, one reason was coz I thought I was asexual back then
6/24/24, 12:23 AM - Sayanth: We are kinda alike
6/24/24, 12:23 AM - Aishwarya: Then another reason was because I wanted to be virgin till marriage ( previously)
6/24/24, 12:24 AM - Sayanth: Oh understandable
6/24/24, 12:24 AM - Aishwarya: Oh 
You used to think you are  asexual ?
But aren't guys show signs otherwise, especially during teenage years 
Liking seeing hot girls etc
6/24/24, 12:25 AM - Aishwarya: How is that possible
6/24/24, 12:25 AM - Sayanth: I still am kinda confused
6/24/24, 12:25 AM - Sayanth: Cuz remember this crush thing
6/24/24, 12:26 AM - Aishwarya: I mean guys get boners seeing naked hot girls 
Or just hot girls in provocative clothing 
In their teenage years
6/24/24, 12:26 AM - Sayanth: It's purely because of personality
6/24/24, 12:26 AM - Aishwarya: Not always 
But happens 
To majority guys
6/24/24, 12:27 AM - Sayanth: Yeah it's normal like every boy gets it
6/24/24, 12:28 AM - Aishwarya: Yea 
And you didn't?

Sorry I just asked coz you used to think you are asexual 
Did I understand correctly
6/24/24, 12:28 AM - Sayanth: So I never had a sexual thought about my crush for some reason so it's kinda making me question if I'm Asexual
6/24/24, 12:28 AM - Aishwarya: Oh this I know 😂
6/24/24, 12:28 AM - Sayanth: Oh I do
6/24/24, 12:29 AM - Aishwarya: Like the previous guy friend I told about ,he used to have a porn addiction sort of
6/24/24, 12:29 AM - Sayanth: Oh
6/24/24, 12:30 AM - Aishwarya: But he told me he has never sexted his ex 
He said he never had such an interaction with her 
( for some reason I felt it was not a lie ,coz told he had porn addiction right ,so he was not trying to appear like nice guy or whatever even )
6/24/24, 12:31 AM - Aishwarya: His last relationship was 6 months , it was an ldr
But still
6/24/24, 12:31 AM - Aishwarya: Oh and his ex looked cute ,atleast from the pic he send
6/24/24, 12:31 AM - Sayanth: Hmmm ok I guess I'm not Asexual then
6/24/24, 12:32 AM - Aishwarya: Yea haha 

I asked coz otherwise whatever I know about men's sexuality is not true lol 😂
6/24/24, 12:32 AM - Aishwarya: Then I will feel like whatever else I know is also not true
6/24/24, 12:32 AM - Aishwarya: Yk
6/24/24, 12:33 AM - Aishwarya: Hence why I asked , after you told so
6/24/24, 12:33 AM - Sayanth: Did he tell u that he's an addict ?
6/24/24, 12:35 AM - Aishwarya: Yea 
Also addiction depends on the intensity 
Porn and weed was something he was doing too much ,which was effecting his life 
So he did the no fap thing
And he reduced the porn by a lot
6/24/24, 12:35 AM - Sayanth: Also I wanted to ask when did u take that pic in ur pfp
6/24/24, 12:36 AM - Aishwarya: Yea 
Although addict is not the word 
Coz I know guys who watch lot of porn , but had good grades 
Imo addiction is something that effects life badly
6/24/24, 12:36 AM - Aishwarya: In 2023 Oct
6/24/24, 12:36 AM - Sayanth: Oh he takes weed too
6/24/24, 12:36 AM - Sayanth: Oh ok
6/24/24, 12:36 AM - Aishwarya: Used to 
He took weed from 10 th I think
6/24/24, 12:37 AM - Sayanth: U don't look 29 in that . That's why
6/24/24, 12:37 AM - Aishwarya: Oh thanks haha
6/24/24, 12:37 AM - Sayanth: Huh where do they get these stuff from
6/24/24, 12:37 AM - Aishwarya: Some people have told me that in general
6/24/24, 12:37 AM - Aishwarya: Oh from his friend
6/24/24, 12:37 AM - Sayanth: Not a compliment but u really don't look 29 like 24 max tbh
6/24/24, 12:38 AM - Sayanth: Where does he get that tho
6/24/24, 12:38 AM - Aishwarya: Thanks 😄
Some people have told so
6/24/24, 12:38 AM - Aishwarya: That friend is rich
6/24/24, 12:38 AM - Sayanth: Oh
6/24/24, 12:38 AM - Aishwarya: His dad was involved in some illegal business
6/24/24, 12:38 AM - Aishwarya: Oh and his friend had committed suicide
6/24/24, 12:39 AM - Sayanth: Oh Damn
6/24/24, 12:39 AM - Aishwarya: In first year of college ,beginning
6/24/24, 12:39 AM - Sayanth: Why
6/24/24, 12:39 AM - Aishwarya: After that he changed to another college
6/24/24, 12:40 AM - Aishwarya: I think related to his dad also 
His dad and his business partner had a lot of drama 
His dad cheated the other guy 
He also don't know the exact reason
6/24/24, 12:41 AM - Aishwarya: Also he said that this guy was very happy that day night 
Five friends ,their gang ,had met for weed etc 
Plus I think it was some festival day 
They were very chill
6/24/24, 12:41 AM - Aishwarya: And next day morning I think ,he committed suicide by hanging from a tree
6/24/24, 12:42 AM - Sayanth: Yeah I heard people get really happy just before committing suicide
6/24/24, 12:42 AM - Sayanth: Cuz it's all ending soon for them all the suffering
6/24/24, 12:42 AM - Aishwarya: Yea I have read so in some places ,plus reels I think
6/24/24, 12:42 AM - Aishwarya: Oh 
Yea
6/24/24, 12:43 AM - Aishwarya: But this guy ,noone knew he was sad
6/24/24, 12:43 AM - Aishwarya: He told why he didn't talk with him etc
6/24/24, 12:43 AM - Aishwarya: About any sadness
6/24/24, 12:44 AM - Aishwarya: He had no idea ,that his friend is suffering 
But he can't know right ,unless the other guys says so 
That was the story
6/24/24, 12:44 AM - Sayanth: Yup
6/24/24, 12:44 AM - Aishwarya: So he said he couldn't believe it
6/24/24, 12:44 AM - Aishwarya: Coz no signs
6/24/24, 12:44 AM - Sayanth: Some just hides it pretty well
6/24/24, 12:45 AM - Aishwarya: Yea ig 
Idk how
6/24/24, 12:45 AM - Aishwarya: I have heard that guys cry it out while they get together for alcohol ,weed etc
6/24/24, 12:45 AM - Aishwarya: Not cry but say the sad feeling
6/24/24, 12:46 AM - Sayanth: I used to keep everything to myself
6/24/24, 12:46 AM - Aishwarya: His case ,that was not there too 
He said
6/24/24, 12:46 AM - Aishwarya: Oh
6/24/24, 12:46 AM - Sayanth: Yeah yeah
6/24/24, 12:46 AM - Aishwarya: This was not a thing in your college?
6/24/24, 12:47 AM - Sayanth: Nope
6/24/24, 12:47 AM - Aishwarya: Oh
6/24/24, 12:47 AM - Aishwarya: Okay
6/24/24, 12:47 AM - Aishwarya: I think mostly in cities colleges then
6/24/24, 12:47 AM - Sayanth: May be it's but I guess perhaps I might be too innocent to know
6/24/24, 12:48 AM - Aishwarya: Oh 
Your friends circle were mostly introverted type guys ?
6/24/24, 12:48 AM - Sayanth: College IL almost no friends
6/24/24, 12:49 AM - Aishwarya: Oh
6/24/24, 12:49 AM - Sayanth: So I don't know what's going on there
6/24/24, 12:49 AM - Aishwarya: Because you were focused on studies ?
Or they were not your vibe ?
6/24/24, 12:50 AM - Sayanth: They weren't My type
6/24/24, 12:50 AM - Aishwarya: And usually less friends people are more real 
But it depends though
6/24/24, 12:50 AM - Aishwarya: Coz some extrovert people, they be friends with anybody 
Like even with people they hold grudge with
6/24/24, 12:51 AM - Sayanth: Yesss ik ik
6/24/24, 12:51 AM - Aishwarya: Oh okay haha 
Seems like everyone has college drama stories 💀😂
Ofcourse
6/24/24, 12:51 AM - Sayanth: They act all cool outside idk how they do it tho
6/24/24, 12:51 AM - Aishwarya: Yess
Howw
6/24/24, 12:52 AM - Aishwarya: But it's a skill which is useful in the world 
World is kind of made for extroverts ,they get job raise through connections ,things like that
6/24/24, 12:53 AM - Sayanth: Yesss realized that kinda late they get things done with those connections
6/24/24, 12:53 AM - Sayanth: Also
6/24/24, 12:53 AM - Aishwarya: Yea
6/24/24, 12:53 AM - Sayanth: ഞാന്‍ ഇവിടെ കുറിക്കാന്‍ പോകുന്നത് എന്റെ സ്വന്തം അനുഭവങ്ങളില്‍ നിന്നുണ്ടായ കാര്യങ്ങളെ കുറിച്ച് ആണ്‌.  

1) ഞാന്‍ 2016-2021 വരെ ഇവിടെ പഠിച്ചു.  എന്റെ കുട്ടിക്കാലം ഭൂരിഭാഗം ഇവിടെ ഞാന്‍ ചിലവഴിച്ചു.  
 
ഞാൻ അനുഭവിച്ച മാനസിക പീഡനത്തിൻ്റെ അളവ് വാക്കുകളിൽ പറഞ്ഞറിയിക്കാൻ കഴിയില്ല
വിദ്യാർത്ഥികളെ കന്നുകാലികളെ പോലെയാണ് പരിഗണിച്ചത് , സ്‌പോർട്‌സ് കലകൾക്കും പാഠ്യേതര പ്രവർത്തനങ്ങൾക്കും ശരിയായ പ്രോത്സാഹനം ഉണ്ടായിരുന്നില്ല, അവർക്ക് ഫുൾ എ പ്ലസ് മാത്രമായിരുന്നു പ്രധാന ശ്രദ്ധ. ഞാന്‍ പഠിക്കുമ്പോൾ അത് ഒരു കോൺസെൻട്രേഷൻ ക്യാമ്പ് പോലെ തോന്നി, വിദ്യാർത്ഥികളെ A-Z മുതൽ വിവിധ ക്ലാസുകളായി തരംതിരിച്ചു, 9-ആം പരീക്ഷയിൽ നല്ല മാർക്ക് നേടിയ വിദ്യാർത്ഥികളെ A ക്ലാസിലും മറ്റുള്ളവരെ താഴ്ന്ന ക്ലാസുകളിലും ആക്കി. ഇത് സാധാരണമല്ല, അശാസ്ത്രീയമാണ്, ഇത് വിദ്യാർത്ഥികൾക്കിടയിൽ അപകർഷതാബോധത്തിനും ശ്രേഷ്ഠതയ്ക്കും കാരണമായി 

2) പെൺകുട്ടികളെയും ആൺകുട്ടികളെയും വെവ്വേറെ സ്പീഷിസുകളായി കണക്കാക്കുന്നു, ഒരു ആൺകുട്ടി പെൺകുട്ടിയോട് സംസാരിച്ചാൽ അവർ ഒരു ബന്ധത്തിലാണെന്ന് അധ്യാപകർ അനുമാനിക്കുകയും ഉടൻ മാതാപിതാക്കളെ ബന്ധപ്പെടുകയും അവരുടെ മകൻ/മകൾ സ്കൂളിൽ മോശം കാര്യങ്ങൾ ചെയ്യുന്നുവെന്ന് അവരോട് പറയുകയും ചെയ്തു.  പെൺകുട്ടികൾക്കും ആൺകുട്ടികൾക്കും വ്യത്യസ്ത പടികളിലൂടെ നടക്കേണ്ടി വന്നു .അവർക്ക് വ്യത്യസ്ത ഇടവേള സമയവും ഉണ്ടായിരുന്നു. ലൈംഗിക വിദ്യാഭ്യാസം ഇല്ലായിരുന്നു .ചെറിയ തെറ്റുകൾക്ക് അല്ലെങ്കിൽ ഒരു ഉത്തരം തെറ്റിയതിന് പോലും അവർ വിദ്യാർത്ഥികളെ തല്ലി , രക്തം വരുത്തി - ഞാന്‍ അത് ചൂണ്ടിക്കാണിച്ചു അപ്പോൾ എന്നെയും തല്ലി.  

3) മാനേജ്‌മെൻ്റും അധ്യാപകര്‍ തമ്മിൽ തർക്കം വേറെ , 
ചില അദ്ധ്യാപകർ നല്ലവരായിരുന്നു, എന്നാൽഭൂരിഭാഗവും എവറസ്റ്റിനെക്കാൾ ഉയർന്ന ഈഗോകൾ ഉള്ളവര്‍.  
കൂടുതൽ യോഗ്യതയുള്ള കോളേജ് അധ്യാപകർ അവരെക്കാൾ വിനയാന്വിതരായിരുന്നു. ചില അധ്യാപകർക്ക് ശരിയായ  ഇംഗ്ലീഷ് പോലും അറിയില്ല! 

4)പുതിയ യൂണിഫോം ചെലവേറിയതും കാലാവസ്ഥയ്ക്ക് അനുയോജ്യവുമല്ല ! 

5) ഇപ്പോൾ അവർ പ്രത്യേക ഐടി ക്ലാസുകൾക്ക് കൂടുതൽ നിരക്ക് ഈടാക്കുകയും അതിൻ്റെ അടിസ്ഥാനത്തിൽ വിദ്യാർത്ഥികളെ വേർതിരിക്കുകയും ചെയ്യുന്നു

6)നിങ്ങളുടെ കുട്ടിയുടെ സ്കൂൾ ജീവിതം മോശമായിരിക്കും , guarantee ! 

7) നല്ല മാർക്ക് കിട്ടുന്നത് അധ്യാപകരുടെയോ സ്കൂളിൻ്റെയോ കഴിവ് അല്ല അത്  വിദ്യാർത്ഥികളുടെ കഠിനാധ്വാനം കൊണ്ടാണ് എന്നത്‌ എപ്പോളും ഓര്‍ക്കുക. 

പൂജ്യം നക്ഷത്രങ്ങൾ ഇടാനുള്ള ഓപ്ഷൻ എനിക്കുണ്ടായിരുന്നെങ്കിൽ ഞാൻ അത് ചെയ്യുമായിരുന്നു. അതുകൊണ്ട്‌ please ഞാൻ അനുഭവിച്ചത് നിങ്ങളുടെ മക്കള്‍ക്ക് വരാതിരിക്കാന്‍ , ഇവിടെ join ചെയ്യരുത് !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

6/24/24, 4:11 PM - Sayanth: Did u study
6/24/24, 4:11 PM - Sayanth: ?
6/24/24, 4:11 PM - Aishwarya: No ,today I was with my friend, texting her
6/24/24, 4:11 PM - Sayanth: Oh
6/24/24, 4:11 PM - Aishwarya: Ya
6/24/24, 4:13 PM - Aishwarya: I haven't yet phone called her 
I had met her in May last year
6/24/24, 4:13 PM - Sayanth: Oh
6/24/24, 4:13 PM - Sayanth: I wanna move on from crush
6/24/24, 4:13 PM - Sayanth: It's bad
6/24/24, 4:13 PM - Aishwarya: But I'm not gonna do it anytime soon 
I'm afraid it will be awkward lol
6/24/24, 4:13 PM - Sayanth: I don't want to feel anything
6/24/24, 4:14 PM - Aishwarya: Not afraid but yea
6/24/24, 4:14 PM - Sayanth: That with anxiety it's soo fking stressful
6/24/24, 4:14 PM - Sayanth: Oh it's not gonna be
6/24/24, 4:15 PM - Aishwarya: For me it's like 
I feel good feelings when I think about my crush 
Like I used to sometimes imagine romantic scenarios and sex lol 
Hence why I got attached kind of I guess 
But now I'm kind of detached
6/24/24, 4:15 PM - Sayanth: I can't detach
6/24/24, 4:15 PM - Sayanth: For some reason
6/24/24, 4:16 PM - Aishwarya: The main negative is that he adds so many girls on insta from dating apps and insta ig
Things like that
6/24/24, 4:16 PM - Aishwarya: But I can move on from him rn if I wanted to 
It's just that I like the good feelings attached to him
6/24/24, 4:16 PM - Aishwarya: So I kind of don't want to move on
6/24/24, 4:17 PM - Aishwarya: But crushes from the same class are more complicated though 
Coz we have to see them all the time
6/24/24, 4:17 PM - Aishwarya: Why ?
6/24/24, 4:18 PM - Aishwarya: Oh
6/24/24, 4:18 PM - Sayanth: Idk attachment issues
6/24/24, 4:18 PM - Sayanth: 😭
6/24/24, 4:18 PM - Aishwarya: What about the crush is making you anxious though 
That she might like some other guy ?
6/24/24, 4:20 PM - Aishwarya: This book is recommended to girls for dating 
Coz a lot of girls gets attached to the guy 

About guys there are few exceptions, coz guys can get hella attached too 
Unfortunately for you, from what you said ,you seem to be like that
6/24/24, 4:21 PM - Aishwarya: Oh and maybe try liking more people lol 
It's not like its a relationship, so no need to limit to one person
6/24/24, 4:21 PM - Aishwarya: And some people do that while in relationship even ,especially guys 
Which is wrong
6/24/24, 4:21 PM - Aishwarya: But you are single right 
Maybe casually talk to more girls ?
6/24/24, 4:22 PM - Aishwarya: Or if you don't want to do that ,then I think if you are that attached to her and don't want to 
The way to move on is to go no contact with her
6/24/24, 4:23 PM - Sayanth: It doesn't work like that for me
6/24/24, 4:24 PM - Aishwarya: Hmm okay
6/24/24, 4:24 PM - Sayanth: I can't like someone else once I get feelings for someone
6/24/24, 4:25 PM - Aishwarya: But you get attracted to other people right?
And you said you haven't even seen her, so imo it's just platonic yk
6/24/24, 4:25 PM - Sayanth: Also I don't get along with anyone easily
6/24/24, 4:25 PM - Sayanth: Not really I don't get attracted easily I want to know their personality if I wanna like them
6/24/24, 4:26 PM - Aishwarya: Oh
I think you should put more boundaries and cut off those who are crossing it 
Then it will be okay
6/24/24, 4:26 PM - Aishwarya: Hmm okay
6/24/24, 4:27 PM - Aishwarya: So you want to move on from that girl or no?🤔
What do you want for yourself?
6/24/24, 4:27 PM - Sayanth: Yeah ig
6/24/24, 4:27 PM - Sayanth: Move on
6/24/24, 4:27 PM - Aishwarya: Okay then you have to block her 
After politely telling her some reason
6/24/24, 4:29 PM - Aishwarya: Yesterday you had anxiety coz of same reason right 
I think you need to do what works best for you 
Do you not think not moving on is causing you more harm than good
6/24/24, 4:29 PM - Aishwarya: And you have to think what positive effect she has on your life
6/24/24, 4:29 PM - Aishwarya: If positive effect is more ,then maybe reconsider
6/24/24, 4:30 PM - Sayanth: Dude ik
6/24/24, 4:30 PM - Sayanth: I wanna block
6/24/24, 4:30 PM - Sayanth: But I love her
6/24/24, 4:30 PM - Sayanth: Like I'm deeply in love
6/24/24, 4:30 PM - Sayanth: I wanna get detached
6/24/24, 4:30 PM - Sayanth: First
6/24/24, 4:31 PM - Aishwarya: You can't detach while you are in contact with her <This message was edited>

6/24/24, 11:39 PM - Sayanth: Won't block her
6/24/24, 11:39 PM - Sayanth: But I won't put much efforts I guess

People are usually busy anyways

6/24/24, 11:45 PM - Sayanth: You send ok thrice
6/24/24, 11:45 PM - Aishwarya: Since she didn't do you any wrong, that can be done 
She shouldn't feel like you ghosted her

6/25/24, 4:30 PM - Aishwarya: Okay
6/25/24, 4:30 PM - Aishwarya: My previous crush he updated his new dp
6/25/24, 4:31 PM - Aishwarya: In that ,his friends are looking at him 💀
A group pic from two years ago it is I think
6/25/24, 4:34 PM - Aishwarya: I suddenly thought that something I told yesterday about crush got leaked 💀
That's literally not possible ofcourse, coz kerala is so big 

And it was about my present crush anyways 
Not this guy from college ,who I don't like at all anymore
6/25/24, 4:35 PM - Aishwarya: I just told to get it out of my head
6/25/24, 4:35 PM - Sayanth: Oh yeah totally relatable
6/25/24, 4:35 PM - Aishwarya: Oh okay then

6/25/24, 4:38 PM - Aishwarya: Yea true
6/25/24, 4:39 PM - Aishwarya: So your overthinking is small levels right ?
6/25/24, 4:39 PM - Sayanth: Also I didn't text her at all today or last day
6/25/24, 4:39 PM - Sayanth: Not exactly
6/25/24, 4:39 PM - Aishwarya: Oh okay

6/25/24, 4:40 PM - Sayanth: Like that's my thoughts go
6/25/24, 4:41 PM - Aishwarya: You are more than good enough as a person 

But I know, sometimes mind just thinks stuff
6/25/24, 4:41 PM - Sayanth: Not good
6/25/24, 4:41 PM - Sayanth: I had an exam today I didn't attend it
6/25/24, 4:41 PM - Sayanth: Because of anxiety
6/25/24, 4:43 PM - Aishwarya: Okay 
I feel like it's stemming from abandonment wounds from parents ? ( it effects different people differently, based on the brain sensitivity etc probably)

So I think it can reversed back, a lot 
Intentionally speak to yourself kindly
6/25/24, 4:43 PM - Aishwarya: Oh no
6/25/24, 4:43 PM - Aishwarya: Is it an important exam ?
6/25/24, 4:44 PM - Aishwarya: Will it give you supply sort of thing?
6/25/24, 4:44 PM - Sayanth: Yeah it's that's what my therapist said as well

Like now you feel like talking to someone about it right? About the exam
6/25/24, 4:48 PM - Aishwarya: The anxiety about today's exam was related to what btw ?
Is it that you are afraid that you won't remember what you studied ?
6/25/24, 4:48 PM - Sayanth: Yeah yeah
6/25/24, 4:49 PM - Sayanth: Nah nah it's just other things
6/25/24, 4:49 PM - Aishwarya: Why you didn't talk to anyone ,maybe that could have motivated you to go for the exam right
6/25/24, 4:49 PM - Sayanth: The anxiety had nothing to do with the exam but it's kinda affecting everything in my life
6/25/24, 4:49 PM - Aishwarya: Ohh 
Okay

6/25/24, 4:54 PM - Aishwarya: I think once you get to the job place , the interest and skills in the career is more important 
So there is a bright side
6/25/24, 4:54 PM - Aishwarya: Okay
6/25/24, 4:54 PM - Aishwarya: Okay

6/25/24, 11:56 PM - Sayanth: 🥺🥺🥺
6/25/24, 11:56 PM - Sayanth: 🫂🫂🫂
6/25/24, 11:57 PM - Sayanth: In some sense we are kinda same
6/25/24, 11:58 PM - Aishwarya: I'm not even in contact with him actually 
Like he changed his whatsapp ( it was few days after he got to know that I'm kind of obsessed with him ,but idk if there is any correlation )

It felt like he wanted me to ask for his new whatsapp 
😂idk probably not
6/25/24, 11:58 PM - Sayanth: Eh so how are u gonna ask his wa
6/25/24, 11:58 PM - Sayanth: Like through call
6/25/24, 11:58 PM - Sayanth: ?
6/25/24, 11:58 PM - Aishwarya: Yea 
But like in your case it's different in the sense ,most girls are not promiscuous vibe types yk
6/26/24, 12:00 AM - Aishwarya: No 
I have only texted with him for like one day ,continuous kind of 

And then two other days ,just a bit 😂
6/26/24, 12:01 AM - Aishwarya: I created a fake Instagram account just to see his following 💀
Hence I have two IG accounts
6/26/24, 12:01 AM - Aishwarya: That insta is some other name 
But recently I saw a reel where people can know the real name 💀
6/26/24, 12:01 AM - Sayanth: Nooo they can't
6/26/24, 12:02 AM - Aishwarya: It's like the Gmail account I used to create that insta ,it has my real name
6/26/24, 12:02 AM - Sayanth: Unless u have linked it with real account
6/26/24, 12:02 AM - Sayanth: That's still fine
6/26/24, 12:02 AM - Sayanth: No one can find that
6/26/24, 12:02 AM - Aishwarya: But like if somebody does that ,I will get a Gmail notification 
I haven't yet
6/26/24, 12:03 AM - Aishwarya: It's like they have to type in my IG account and give forgot password 
And it will show my Gmail account to them
6/26/24, 12:03 AM - Aishwarya: Something like that 
Not sure though 
I hope not 💀
6/26/24, 12:03 AM - Aishwarya: Yea I hope so 😂
6/26/24, 12:09 AM - Sayanth: Oh that but it won't show ur entire email id
6/26/24, 12:10 AM - Sayanth: It'll only show first 3 letters or something
6/26/24, 12:10 AM - Sayanth: Like
6/26/24, 12:10 AM - Sayanth: What does that mean
6/26/24, 12:11 AM - Aishwarya: Oh 
It has my name 
But I think I will get a notification on Gmail if he do that right
6/26/24, 12:11 AM - Sayanth: Yup
6/26/24, 12:11 AM - Sayanth: Stop overthinking he's not that intelligent
6/26/24, 12:11 AM - Sayanth: Hopefully
6/26/24, 12:12 AM - Aishwarya: I mean you can have crush on someone who likes you back and is not a hoe 
But yes it's not that simple 
I just meant that most girls are not hoes ,atleast here in india
6/26/24, 12:12 AM - Aishwarya: Okay 
Yea
6/26/24, 12:12 AM - Sayanth: Oh yeah
6/26/24, 12:13 AM - Aishwarya: Yea , I'm in a girls group 
And in there, kind of 1/3 of the conversation is about dating 
And they complain a lot about guys 
So a universal problem I guess 😂
6/26/24, 12:14 AM - Aishwarya: Previously I wanted to be part of girls group so bad 
To find friends 
This group is small though
6/26/24, 12:14 AM - Sayanth: Ohhh
6/26/24, 12:14 AM - Sayanth: How did u find it tho
6/26/24, 12:15 AM - Aishwarya: But I'm not really friends with any of them ,atleast yet 
I'm just in that group 
I'm not that active too
6/26/24, 12:16 AM - Aishwarya: From reddit actually 💀😂
One friend from there recommended it to me
6/26/24, 12:17 AM - Sayanth: Is it telegram?
6/26/24, 12:17 AM - Aishwarya: Discord and whatsapp group
6/26/24, 12:18 AM - Sayanth: Oh
6/26/24, 12:18 AM - Sayanth: So like whats the 2/3 of the convo about <This message was edited>
6/26/24, 12:19 AM - Aishwarya: Just general stuff 
Studies, job, friends etc
6/26/24, 12:20 AM - Aishwarya: I like the group but unfortunately I don't like the vibe of some members 
But I like the admin girl though 
She is cool 
I have added her on whatapp 
Although not friends
6/26/24, 12:22 AM - Sayanth: Oh great
6/26/24, 12:23 AM - Aishwarya: I can message in group and maybe built a friendship with her 
But that's too much efforts 
And probably it won't be successful even
6/26/24, 12:23 AM - Sayanth: Well no harm in trying
6/26/24, 12:24 AM - Aishwarya: Plus there are other girls that I can be friends with
I had met some friends on an app called slowly 
I found three girls 
I liked two of them 
And added them on insta
6/26/24, 12:25 AM - Sayanth: Oh
6/26/24, 12:25 AM - Sayanth: I've slowly too
6/26/24, 12:25 AM - Aishwarya: Oh nice
6/26/24, 12:25 AM - Sayanth: But it doesn't have much boys from kerala I guess
6/26/24, 12:26 AM - Sayanth: I found some guy and a girl from us
6/26/24, 12:26 AM - Sayanth: But girl was like Jesus loves u, Jesus is the only  real god
6/26/24, 12:26 AM - Aishwarya: Oh idk
I think I had found some 
Like I had put the settings in a way that only I can send request to them
And I send request one kerala guy whose profile I liked
6/26/24, 12:27 AM - Sayanth: And that guy had no characters
6/26/24, 12:27 AM - Sayanth: Character
6/26/24, 12:27 AM - Sayanth: **
6/26/24, 12:27 AM - Sayanth: Oh
6/26/24, 12:27 AM - Sayanth: U can do that
6/26/24, 12:28 AM - Sayanth: Then I found a chechi from kerala
6/26/24, 12:28 AM - Aishwarya: Back then I had some biases 
Like this dude had lgbtq something on his profile 
And then when I texted him ,after some conversations, he didn't know about aesexuality 
I was asking him about his bio
6/26/24, 12:28 AM - Sayanth: Then another Bengali with kerala origins
6/26/24, 12:29 AM - Aishwarya: It seemed like he put all that ,just to impress girls or impress people 
Or probably just to be cool 

Which is alright
6/26/24, 12:29 AM - Aishwarya: Nice
6/26/24, 12:29 AM - Sayanth: Yeah I've seen people doing that a lot
6/26/24, 12:30 AM - Aishwarya: I have a few friends from US , I liked many of them guys and girls 
But they had to be far away 
Them I met from reddit though 
Some I met accidentally 

From slowly I was mainly looking for friends from india
6/26/24, 12:30 AM - Aishwarya: Oh 😂
6/26/24, 12:31 AM - Aishwarya: Oh ,what he did ?
6/26/24, 12:31 AM - Sayanth: Nothing his letters were like written by ai
6/26/24, 12:31 AM - Aishwarya: Oh , nice 
Are you both acquaintances?
6/26/24, 12:31 AM - Aishwarya: Oh okay
6/26/24, 12:31 AM - Sayanth: There was nothing interesting in it
6/26/24, 12:32 AM - Aishwarya: Oh okay 😂
6/26/24, 12:32 AM - Sayanth: Well we do exchange letters
6/26/24, 12:32 AM - Sayanth: That's all
6/26/24, 12:32 AM - Aishwarya: Okay
6/26/24, 12:32 AM - Sayanth: Pnne I didn't ask socials cuz I kinda liked writing letters so
6/26/24, 12:34 AM - Aishwarya: This dude when I told him about my dad thing 
He said something like if their sex life is okay ,probably that's why he behave like that 
But still it's wrong blah blah 
Like dude 😑

And then he asked something else too ,which I don't want to say rn

Anyways dude is dumb or what idk
6/26/24, 12:35 AM - Aishwarya: Like I don't mind if he is flirting or even beyond that with me 
I mean I don't prefer that 

But like to say something atrocious while I'm said about my trauma
How dumb is he
6/26/24, 12:35 AM - Aishwarya: Oh okay
6/26/24, 12:36 AM - Sayanth: Well I'm not surprised 🙃 sorry u had to through something like that
6/26/24, 12:36 AM - Aishwarya: It was a lesson though 
I have never met this dumb person irl or online 
Just read stories
6/26/24, 12:37 AM - Aishwarya: Yea 😊
6/26/24, 12:38 AM - Aishwarya: Also I have a doubt 
what do we have to reply to, sorry you had to go through something like that 
It is, thanks for understanding right ?
6/26/24, 12:38 AM - Aishwarya: I have thought about it before haha
6/26/24, 12:38 AM - Sayanth: Well tbh I've no idea
6/26/24, 12:38 AM - Aishwarya: Okay 😅😂
6/26/24, 12:39 AM - Aishwarya: And there was a guy from tamil nadu 
I thought of this kerala guy as better person than TN guy 
So after that happened I stopped talking to him too
Like I was not talking to him ,but like we had connected on discord
6/26/24, 12:40 AM - Sayanth: I've met many idiots irl and online so not at all surprising
6/26/24, 12:40 AM - Sayanth: Oh
6/26/24, 12:40 AM - Sayanth: What did he do!
6/26/24, 12:40 AM - Aishwarya: Actually the TN guy had adviced me to remove something from my bio 
I can't say what 

I didn't think of it before
So yea that was bit helpful
6/26/24, 12:40 AM - Aishwarya: Yea
6/26/24, 12:42 AM - Aishwarya: He didn't do anything 
For some reason i felt like he was being nice to me for sex etc or maybe more than that dating 

After the other guy did that
6/26/24, 12:43 AM - Sayanth: Oh that's sad
6/26/24, 12:44 AM - Aishwarya: Like it ended on good terms only 
And I didn't have time to become friends with people I have doubts about
6/26/24, 12:45 AM - Aishwarya: I have many of acquaintances like that 
From US etc 
Coz of time difference though
6/26/24, 12:45 AM - Sayanth: Oh ok that's understandable
6/26/24, 12:45 AM - Aishwarya: Ya
6/26/24, 12:46 AM - Aishwarya: Oh ,there was a girl from the UK whose vibe i liked 
I had once voice called her 
She agreed to that too
6/26/24, 12:47 AM - Sayanth: Oh great
6/26/24, 12:47 AM - Sayanth: Do u still talk to her
6/26/24, 12:47 AM - Sayanth: !
6/26/24, 12:47 AM - Aishwarya: But during the call after like 15 minutes , she told she have to go ,coz she want to vomit 
I asked her why 
She said it's coz of her anxiety 
I have social anxiety too 
Idk which anxiety related it was
6/26/24, 12:48 AM - Aishwarya: I have a guy friend from Scotland
He was nice 
But I didn't have time 
Plus I felt like I will lose the friend after sometime and that the time invested will be for nothing 
So I stopped talking to him
6/26/24, 12:49 AM - Sayanth: Oh yeah it's a thing I just Googled
6/26/24, 12:49 AM - Sayanth: Also I heard some people vomit when they lie
6/26/24, 12:49 AM - Aishwarya: I felt bit sad 
And some type of way 
Coz she literally agreed ,she could have told before
I was so excited that I made a friend to talk to 
But I know it's not her fault
6/26/24, 12:50 AM - Aishwarya: Oh 🤔
6/26/24, 12:50 AM - Sayanth: Some kinda disorder forgot it's name
6/26/24, 12:50 AM - Aishwarya: Ohh
6/26/24, 12:51 AM - Sayanth: And u didn't continue the connection
6/26/24, 12:51 AM - Aishwarya: I wanted a, talk on call also, type of friendship with her 
I felt like it's not possible
6/26/24, 12:52 AM - Aishwarya: Coz texting means it's not that close 
Plus the not even the same country 
What if I spend so much time and like the friendship is no more
6/26/24, 12:53 AM - Sayanth: Oh
6/26/24, 12:54 AM - Aishwarya: In the sense ,I felt like the friendship long term is not possible with her ,atleast for some long time 
This was a rare scenario though
So it's okay 
But sometimes I feel I don't have much luck in friendship also
6/26/24, 12:54 AM - Aishwarya: And good friends is all I want currently
6/26/24, 12:55 AM - Sayanth: Also it'll take some time for me too if we are gonna call
6/26/24, 12:55 AM - Aishwarya: That's okay 😅😁
6/26/24, 12:56 AM - Aishwarya: And in your case you are mallu right 
It's always nice to have online friends from my own state
6/26/24, 12:56 AM - Sayanth: Just in case if u want reassurance I won't leave u like that like cut contacts so it won't be a waste
6/26/24, 12:57 AM - Sayanth: Oh come on I got ur back
6/26/24, 12:57 AM - Aishwarya: Okay 😄

6/26/24, 1:01 AM - Sayanth: Kinda horror fantasy
6/26/24, 1:01 AM - Sayanth: Not ghost

6/26/24, 1:01 AM - Aishwarya: Okay then

Both are same genre right
6/26/24, 1:02 AM - Sayanth: Yeah
6/26/24, 1:02 AM - Sayanth: Yeah
6/26/24, 1:03 AM - Aishwarya: But the thing with ghost movies is that Im kind of afraid that the ghost will be in my room at night 💀😂
6/26/24, 1:03 AM - Sayanth: Same here lol
6/26/24, 1:03 AM - Aishwarya: Oh okay 😂
6/26/24, 1:04 AM - Sayanth: Lol I even cover my head with pillow so that I won't see any ghosts
6/26/24, 1:05 AM - Aishwarya: I remember I was afraid of the aparichithan movie ghost
It was in school times though 
The lowkey fear lasted more than week
6/26/24, 1:05 AM - Aishwarya: Oh 😂
6/26/24, 1:05 AM - Aishwarya: The English movie ghosts I was way less afraid
6/26/24, 1:05 AM - Aishwarya: Those I had watched during college times
6/26/24, 1:06 AM - Sayanth: Why cuz they aren't relatable
6/26/24, 1:06 AM - Sayanth: !
6/26/24, 1:06 AM - Aishwarya: I think grudge movie ghost was the scariest , comparatively
6/26/24, 1:06 AM - Aishwarya: I think so
6/26/24, 1:06 AM - Sayanth: Have u seen Insidious?
6/26/24, 1:07 AM - Sayanth: I didn't get scared of that movie for some reason

6/26/24, 1:09 AM - Sayanth: What about brahmayugam?
6/26/24, 1:09 AM - Aishwarya: And one of those actresses actually committed suicide 
I was afraid of her lowkey
During school times though 
Coz those were times when I used to watch lot of malayalam movies on TV

6/27/24, 12:39 AM - Aishwarya: Ohh
6/27/24, 12:39 AM - Aishwarya: How did you feel afterwards?
6/27/24, 12:40 AM - Aishwarya: Anxiety
6/27/24, 12:40 AM - Aishwarya: Did you feel ?
6/27/24, 12:40 AM - Aishwarya: Or it is reduced now ?
6/27/24, 10:05 AM - Sayanth: It was
6/27/24, 10:05 AM - Sayanth: Sorry yesterday after sending this message wifi off aayi
6/27/24, 10:05 AM - Sayanth: And I hadn't recharged my sim
6/27/24, 10:05 AM - Sayanth: So net poyi
6/27/24, 10:05 AM - Sayanth: That's why I couldn't reply
6/27/24, 10:06 AM - Sayanth: No after it kinda went up
6/27/24, 10:06 AM - Sayanth: Ipoo It's ok but still there tho
6/27/24, 10:49 AM - Sayanth: Hi
6/27/24, 3:19 PM - Aishwarya: That's good
6/27/24, 3:19 PM - Aishwarya: It's okay 
No problem
6/27/24, 3:19 PM - Aishwarya: Oh
6/27/24, 3:21 PM - Aishwarya: Any particular reason?
Maybe you can tell her 
If it's something that she can help with or change
6/27/24, 3:29 PM - Aishwarya: Hi 😄
6/27/24, 3:52 PM - Sayanth: Nah
6/27/24, 3:52 PM - Sayanth: It's just I'm being jealous whenever I see her talking to someone else
6/27/24, 3:53 PM - Sayanth: And I might be the most possessive person you'll ever see in ur life
6/27/24, 3:53 PM - Sayanth: So it's pretty hard for me to watch that
6/27/24, 3:53 PM - Sayanth: 🥹
6/27/24, 3:53 PM - Sayanth: Except I don't show it outside
6/27/24, 3:53 PM - Sayanth: Nor I try to control anyone
6/27/24, 3:53 PM - Sayanth: Ik it's not upto me
6/27/24, 3:53 PM - Sayanth: But still it hurts tho
6/27/24, 3:55 PM - Sayanth: Like when she kinda flirts with someone else's
6/27/24, 3:55 PM - Sayanth: Or don't gimme any attention
6/27/24, 3:55 PM - Sayanth: But again I can't expect someone else to do that. It's not like she owes me anything
6/27/24, 3:56 PM - Sayanth: So yeah I understand it's my issue
6/27/24, 4:16 PM - Aishwarya: I think that's pretty normal 
But depends on the level of jealousy ofcourse
6/27/24, 4:16 PM - Aishwarya: I was getting ready to go out
6/27/24, 4:16 PM - Aishwarya: Ttyl
6/27/24, 4:17 PM - Aishwarya: Oh who is that ?
6/27/24, 4:20 PM - Sayanth: Oh there's some other guy
6/27/24, 4:37 PM - Sayanth: Ok text me when u are free
6/27/24, 10:38 PM - Aishwarya: I'm free now
6/27/24, 10:38 PM - Aishwarya: I was showering and then eating 
Sorry for late reply
6/27/24, 10:39 PM - Aishwarya: Oh 
Did she tell you about it ?
6/27/24, 10:39 PM - Aishwarya: Also ,do you want to talk about anything related to it ?
I just wanted to listen if that could help
6/27/24, 10:40 PM - Aishwarya: Coz these sort of things can be private for some people ,depends on the person
6/27/24, 11:27 PM - Sayanth: No
6/27/24, 11:27 PM - Sayanth: Reddit
6/27/24, 11:27 PM - Sayanth: I've seen her kinda flirting with him
6/27/24, 11:27 PM - Aishwarya: Oh
6/27/24, 11:27 PM - Aishwarya: Oh okay
6/27/24, 11:27 PM - Sayanth: It's ok
6/27/24, 11:28 PM - Sayanth: Also I wish she said no to me tho
6/27/24, 11:28 PM - Sayanth: It's just she didn't
6/27/24, 11:28 PM - Sayanth: Not no nor yes
6/27/24, 11:28 PM - Aishwarya: I think she would probably be actually flirting if she flirted on reddit and then connected outside with him
6/27/24, 11:28 PM - Sayanth: Yeah I guess
6/27/24, 11:28 PM - Aishwarya: Oh 
Probably coz you are cute to her i guess 😂
6/27/24, 11:29 PM - Sayanth: 🥹🥺
6/27/24, 11:29 PM - Sayanth: Idk if I should be relieved or anxious to hear that
6/27/24, 11:29 PM - Aishwarya: No to what though ?
If she likes you too ?

Did you ask her ?
6/27/24, 11:29 PM - Sayanth: Well I did tell her I've feelings for her
6/27/24, 11:29 PM - Sayanth: I've a huge crush on her
6/27/24, 11:30 PM - Sayanth: She said she understands my feelings
6/27/24, 11:30 PM - Sayanth: And don't be awkward with her
6/27/24, 11:30 PM - Sayanth: She doesn't want that
6/27/24, 11:30 PM - Sayanth: Also checks up on me
6/27/24, 11:30 PM - Aishwarya: I see ,okay
6/27/24, 11:30 PM - Aishwarya: That's good
6/27/24, 11:30 PM - Aishwarya: Also , did you communicate with her about your anxiety ?
6/27/24, 11:31 PM - Aishwarya: Like that day she left you on read you said right 
Did you talk to her about it ?
6/27/24, 11:32 PM - Aishwarya: Okay 
That's good 
Since she didn't say no 
She probably likes you back ?
6/27/24, 11:34 PM - Sayanth: Yes
6/27/24, 11:35 PM - Aishwarya: That's good
6/27/24, 11:35 PM - Sayanth: I don't wanna get my hopes up
6/27/24, 11:35 PM - Sayanth: I just wann move on
6/27/24, 11:35 PM - Sayanth: Live peacefully
6/27/24, 11:35 PM - Sayanth: Without getting any emotional attachments
6/27/24, 11:35 PM - Sayanth: And die
6/27/24, 11:36 PM - Aishwarya: Yes die peacefully at 60 years old haha
6/27/24, 11:37 PM - Aishwarya: Okay ,so why do you still talk to her ?
You said you like her personality
But is it helping you in any way ?
6/27/24, 11:37 PM - Sayanth: Nope
6/27/24, 11:37 PM - Sayanth: It's more like a drug
6/27/24, 11:37 PM - Sayanth: Harmful kinda
6/27/24, 11:38 PM - Sayanth: Like it gives me a temporary happiness
6/27/24, 11:38 PM - Sayanth: And ruins my life In the long run I guess
6/27/24, 11:38 PM - Aishwarya: Drug how ?
You think about her ?
Like limerance kind of thing ?
But you should some idea of her right ?
6/27/24, 11:39 PM - Sayanth: I guess limerance is the correct term
6/27/24, 11:39 PM - Sayanth: W8
6/27/24, 11:39 PM - Sayanth: I'll show u
6/27/24, 11:39 PM - Aishwarya: Drug I can relate 😂
I have limerance kind of thing for my crush 
Today while traveling ,I was in back seat and I was so bored ,I was thinking about my crush 😂
6/27/24, 11:39 PM - Aishwarya: Okay
6/27/24, 11:41 PM - Aishwarya: And I was on my periods ,so i was feeling uncomfortable 
So to distract myself ,I was thinking about him ,but I was aware 
I was not horny or anything
6/27/24, 11:42 PM - Aishwarya: Oh and its the first day of periods 
No mood swings or anything 
Just physical discomfort 
( since you asked previously)

6/27/24, 11:47 PM - Sayanth: Read
6/27/24, 11:47 PM - Aishwarya: Okay
6/27/24, 11:52 PM - Aishwarya: Zion is that guy ?
6/27/24, 11:52 PM - Sayanth: No
6/27/24, 11:52 PM - Sayanth: Where did u get that name
6/27/24, 11:53 PM - Aishwarya: Like the last screenshot
6/27/24, 11:53 PM - Sayanth: Che not
6/27/24, 11:53 PM - Sayanth: That
6/27/24, 11:53 PM - Aishwarya: What's that
6/27/24, 11:53 PM - Sayanth: That's another
6/27/24, 11:53 PM - Sayanth: He's a creep
6/27/24, 11:53 PM - Sayanth: Just ignore that one
6/27/24, 11:53 PM - Aishwarya: Oh
6/27/24, 11:53 PM - Aishwarya: Okay
6/27/24, 11:53 PM - Aishwarya: Okay then ,got confused
6/27/24, 11:54 PM - Aishwarya: Btw I think she likes you back 
Coz if she actually has a good personality but doesn't like you back ,she shouldn't use the words honey and love , in my opinion
6/27/24, 11:54 PM - Aishwarya: So it's either she likes you back
6/27/24, 11:54 PM - Sayanth: Well she uses those words for everyone
6/27/24, 11:54 PM - Aishwarya: Or she doesn't have that much of a good personality
6/27/24, 11:55 PM - Aishwarya: But your case is different 

Since she calls you that ,even after you said you have huge crush on her yk
6/27/24, 11:56 PM - Aishwarya: So if she wants your crush gone ,she will refrain from using love ,honey etc to address you 

So she probably likes you
6/27/24, 11:56 PM - Aishwarya: Does that make sense?
6/27/24, 11:56 PM - Sayanth: Kinda
6/27/24, 11:56 PM - Aishwarya: Ya
6/27/24, 11:57 PM - Sayanth: So what do I do now u got 8 years more experience thsn I do so ur words will be my command
6/27/24, 11:57 PM - Aishwarya: How old she is ?
Idk why she didn't her pics by now 
I feel like she likes you
6/27/24, 11:58 PM - Aishwarya: I don't really have 8 more years experience 
But I do have the experience from 2018 , my first heartbreak 😂
6/27/24, 11:58 PM - Sayanth: 19
6/27/24, 11:58 PM - Aishwarya: I used to research a lot back then about relationship stuff
6/27/24, 11:58 PM - Aishwarya: Okay
6/27/24, 11:59 PM - Aishwarya: Then that part also okay 

I wonder why she didn't send her pic to you yet 
Coz I feel like she likes you 

Probably coz she is worried if you will not like her after seeing her ?
6/28/24, 12:00 AM - Sayanth: Oh
6/28/24, 12:00 AM - Aishwarya: Ya
6/28/24, 12:01 AM - Sayanth: I'm not sure what to do
6/28/24, 12:01 AM - Sayanth: My anxiety is making everything so bad
6/28/24, 12:01 AM - Aishwarya: Oh
6/28/24, 12:02 AM - Aishwarya: Is there anything someone else can help you in your anxiety with ?
6/28/24, 12:02 AM - Aishwarya: By talking over text ?
Like giving you advice 
What kind of help?
Do you think would help
6/28/24, 12:04 AM - Aishwarya: Also, imagine if she likes you , what next ?
Are you gonna pursue relationship with her ?
( coz many guys say long distance relationship don't work for them ,probably not the case for you ) <This message was edited>
6/28/24, 12:05 AM - Aishwarya: You should ask for her pic imo , if you see some future in it 

Depends on what you want in life currently
6/28/24, 12:27 AM - Sayanth: Well when I say love I mean I love their brain I guess their personality their character not body
6/28/24, 12:27 AM - Sayanth: Body only comes second for me
6/28/24, 12:27 AM - Aishwarya: Yea that I understood 

But I have doubt though 
Which I'm not gonna ask 😬
6/28/24, 12:28 AM - Aishwarya: Okay
6/28/24, 12:28 AM - Sayanth: Ask ask ask
6/28/24, 12:29 AM - Sayanth: U said u got a doubt
6/28/24, 12:29 AM - Sayanth: So ask ask ask
6/28/24, 12:29 AM - Sayanth: U got no choice

6/28/24, 12:30 AM - Sayanth: It's ok dude
6/28/24, 12:30 AM - Aishwarya: Okay alojikatte 
How to ask it 😂
6/28/24, 12:31 AM - Sayanth: I'm pretty open with everyone once I get comfortable
6/28/24, 12:31 AM - Aishwarya: Idk 
You seem to be people pleaser 
How do I know if you actually are okay with it
6/28/24, 12:31 AM - Sayanth: Else I won't even drop my name
6/28/24, 12:31 AM - Aishwarya: Oh okay then
6/28/24, 12:32 AM - Aishwarya: What ? Really 
You gave me also , your cv, on first day itself 
To a total stranger haha 😅 <This message was edited>
6/28/24, 12:32 AM - Sayanth: I don't get comfortable around most people
6/28/24, 12:32 AM - Sayanth: But some I do
6/28/24, 12:32 AM - Aishwarya: But yea people have those things on LinkedIn though
6/28/24, 12:32 AM - Aishwarya: Oh okay then
6/28/24, 12:32 AM - Sayanth: Then yeah I'm like I'd even share my Google password
6/28/24, 12:32 AM - Sayanth: Which is the most precious thing I keep
6/28/24, 12:33 AM - Aishwarya: Really 😳
6/28/24, 12:33 AM - Aishwarya: I hope that's a joke 
You gonna become broke my friend 💀😂
6/28/24, 12:33 AM - Sayanth: But I had already told u those info are kinda public
6/28/24, 12:33 AM - Aishwarya: Someone gonna bankrupt you 💀
6/28/24, 12:33 AM - Sayanth: I mean u can't get my bank account with that
6/28/24, 12:33 AM - Sayanth: It's Google
6/28/24, 12:33 AM - Aishwarya: Yaa understood
6/28/24, 12:34 AM - Aishwarya: Hm okay
6/28/24, 12:34 AM - Aishwarya: Ya
6/28/24, 12:34 AM - Sayanth: + even then I've 2 factor authentication
6/28/24, 12:34 AM - Aishwarya: Still risky
6/28/24, 12:34 AM - Sayanth: So even if I give u my password it's totally useless
6/28/24, 12:34 AM - Aishwarya: Okiee haha
6/28/24, 12:34 AM - Aishwarya: I see 🤭 okay then haha
6/28/24, 12:34 AM - Sayanth: Sometimes it doesn't even let me login either
6/28/24, 12:35 AM - Aishwarya: Oh okay
6/28/24, 12:35 AM - Sayanth: Whats ur question tho
6/28/24, 12:37 AM - Sayanth: Is it that long
6/28/24, 12:37 AM - Aishwarya: What about sexual attraction and sex 🤔
I think it's pretty important for guys atleast , atleast upto age 40 I guess 
Or whatever age they give importance to that 
And you are just 20 right ?
It's the important for guys till 25 or maybe upto 30
6/28/24, 12:37 AM - Sayanth: Idk 🤷‍♀️
6/28/24, 12:38 AM - Aishwarya: Really
6/28/24, 12:38 AM - Aishwarya: Have you not felt sexual attraction and lowkey turned on my any attractive girls irl ??
6/28/24, 12:38 AM - Sayanth: For me it's personality I need them to love me not   lust
6/28/24, 12:39 AM - Sayanth: No I guess tbh I don't find many attractive girls
6/28/24, 12:39 AM - Aishwarya: Do you not feel the urge to experience that ?
Atleast out of fomo ?
6/28/24, 12:39 AM - Sayanth: I've pretty high standards
6/28/24, 12:39 AM - Sayanth: Beauty standards
6/28/24, 12:39 AM - Sayanth: Sex ! Not exactly
6/28/24, 12:39 AM - Sayanth: But I do feel like I wanna be loved tho
6/28/24, 12:40 AM - Sayanth: Like sometimes I get so desperate for that but never really showed it outside
6/28/24, 12:40 AM - Aishwarya: Oh but when I was in kannur, there were lot more attractive girls in kannur ( than in south kerala districts, I have been to many districts )
6/28/24, 12:41 AM - Sayanth: Hmm yeah I've heard thalassery girls are kinda one of the most attractive ones
6/28/24, 12:41 AM - Sayanth: Idk how I fell for kollam one tho
6/28/24, 12:41 AM - Aishwarya: Yea ,in kerala
6/28/24, 12:42 AM - Aishwarya: That you like her personality right 
I was not referring to her
6/28/24, 12:42 AM - Sayanth: It's true I guess if u go by the conventional standards
6/28/24, 12:42 AM - Sayanth: Yeah
6/28/24, 12:42 AM - Aishwarya: Yes
6/28/24, 12:42 AM - Aishwarya: I was asking if you don't feel turned on by attractive girls that you see irl
6/28/24, 12:43 AM - Sayanth: Most of my female classmates were at least 7
6/28/24, 12:43 AM - Sayanth: I guess
6/28/24, 12:43 AM - Sayanth: In highschool
6/28/24, 12:43 AM - Aishwarya: Also I think genz girls dress less modestly ?
Even in kerala 
So it's not like they are wearing parda
6/28/24, 12:43 AM - Sayanth: Never really found any of them pretty by my standards tho
6/28/24, 12:43 AM - Aishwarya: What 😂 oh
6/28/24, 12:44 AM - Sayanth: Yeah and my taste is kinda weird
6/28/24, 12:44 AM - Sayanth: Like some boys say they are into naadan/traditional girls
6/28/24, 12:44 AM - Aishwarya: But you see them as a 7 right ?
That means it's attractive to you 

But you mean you didn't get turned on ?
6/28/24, 12:44 AM - Sayanth: But idk I've never really found the sari 🥻 thing attractive
6/28/24, 12:45 AM - Sayanth: No not like that I'm just saying if we go by conventional standards
6/28/24, 12:45 AM - Sayanth: Well if I'm attracted to someone they must be at least a 9
6/28/24, 12:45 AM - Aishwarya: Okay so , there is different kinds of attractive 
Which you probably know 

There is aesthetic attraction , sexual attraction for example
6/28/24, 12:46 AM - Sayanth: Yeah
6/28/24, 12:46 AM - Aishwarya: In terms of sexual attraction right ?
Like you get turned on when you see a girl who is 9
6/28/24, 12:47 AM - Aishwarya: I'm curious btw 😂
6/28/24, 12:48 AM - Aishwarya: Coz this kind of stuff interests me 
So I ask doubts if they are okay with answering yk <This message was edited>
6/28/24, 12:48 AM - Aishwarya: Also you sure you don't mind right?
Is it uncomfortable?
6/28/24, 12:48 AM - Sayanth: Mmm no like it's based on their personality if they have a good interesting personality
6/28/24, 12:48 AM - Aishwarya: That I'm asking
6/28/24, 12:49 AM - Sayanth: I'll prolly find them attractive
6/28/24, 12:49 AM - Sayanth: And then yeah I'll prolly get sexually attracted to them
6/28/24, 12:49 AM - Sayanth: It's ok
6/28/24, 12:51 AM - Aishwarya: I'm kind of confused 
Like how can you be sexually attracted to personality 

If the sexual attraction increases after an emotional bond is formed ,that I understand 
It is demisexual people
6/28/24, 12:51 AM - Sayanth: So it's like if I want to get sexually attracted they should have a great personality
6/28/24, 12:51 AM - Sayanth: Ok I'll explain
6/28/24, 12:51 AM - Aishwarya: Okay then 
Thenks
I'm free to ask then hehe
6/28/24, 12:51 AM - Aishwarya: Okay
6/28/24, 12:54 AM - Sayanth: 1) I need to get attracted to their personality 

2) if I'm attracted to their personality only then I can form an emotional bond

3) only after making an emotional bond can I love someone 

4) only when I'm loving someone can sexualize them or see them through an intimate pov

5) only then can I get turned on by them or have sex with them
6/28/24, 12:54 AM - Sayanth: Feel free to ask Any doubts
6/28/24, 12:56 AM - Aishwarya: Oh okay 
Yea I think that is demisexuality 

I know such a guy 
He said he is virgin at 34 ( by choice ofcourse)
Coz he said he gets attached from sex and is afraid to get heartbroken 
He has dated two girls before 
He is attractive <This message was edited>
6/28/24, 12:58 AM - Aishwarya: So like I'm bi 
I'm more sexually attracted towards women just by the looks 
In men , not really 
And in my mind I was like he didn't make use of his looks 
And he literally lives in bangalore, has his own house ( so he don't have to book oyo even )
😂
6/28/24, 12:58 AM - Aishwarya: Okay ,thanks 🥹
6/28/24, 12:59 AM - Sayanth: 🥹🫂
6/28/24, 12:59 AM - Aishwarya: Like demisexuals don't remain virgins btw 😂

That's just his case
6/28/24, 1:00 AM - Sayanth: Yeah but I'll prolly die a Virgin tho
6/28/24, 1:01 AM - Aishwarya: Even few asexuals ( some greysexuals) ,they change partners often 
Coz they can't stay attracted to one partner for long 
( in west ,I read on reddit)
6/28/24, 1:02 AM - Aishwarya: No dude 
You are cute 
Nice face ,nice hair 
Plus fair 
Otherwise you are okay 
So overall cute 
So no need to worry 🤭
Plus nice person <This message was edited>
6/28/24, 1:02 AM - Sayanth: That's just perverts
6/28/24, 1:02 AM - Sayanth: Yeah ennit I'm still love less tho
6/28/24, 1:03 AM - Aishwarya: Idk 
Imo that's just sexuality 
As long as they and their partner is consenting , no problem in that
6/28/24, 1:03 AM - Sayanth: Yeah
6/28/24, 1:05 AM - Aishwarya: You have to look in the right places 

Shouldn't waste time on unreciprocated stuff for example 
If you are currently look for love, that is
6/28/24, 1:05 AM - Sayanth: But changing partners too often cuz they can't stay attracted that's some bs reason I guess like it's totally ok but making it a sexuality nah doesn't make much sense to me
6/28/24, 1:06 AM - Aishwarya: Like if I'm looking for love currently, I won't be even having crush on that guy 

I will be searching for guys who will like me back and give me a healthy relationship, for example
6/28/24, 1:07 AM - Aishwarya: Okay ,that's true though 

This kind of stuff being normalized is the reason why the dating is so messed up, for people who are actually looking for long term connection
6/28/24, 1:09 AM - Aishwarya: But also , imo many guys are not wired for long term connection 
From what I know 

Girls too probably
6/28/24, 1:11 AM - Aishwarya: Hence why a lot of cheating going on in cities and liberal places ( there people just do whatever they want )

Coz what they want is actually not a long term connection 
I mean they want that too , but they are not wired to be with just that person
6/28/24, 1:11 AM - Sayanth: But I'm wired like that unfortunately
6/28/24, 1:11 AM - Sayanth: 😭
6/28/24, 1:13 AM - Aishwarya: Idk about other girls 
But I have discovered that I can fluctuate both ways 

But guys ,most of them aren't wired that way ,to be with one person
Some of them literally have the girl of their dreams , but still have wandering eyes for other women ( and then some of them proceed to cheat )
Some of them even though they are not wired to be with one person ,they don't cheat coz they know it will give their partner trauma
6/28/24, 1:15 AM - Sayanth: I can't even a look at another woman when I have a crush on someone
6/28/24, 1:15 AM - Aishwarya: Oh 🫂

If so ,I really hope you don't get trauma from some girl 🥺
Please guard your heart 

Choose only the right person 
Still some loopholes might be there ,coz cheating can't be fully prevented by taking precautions 
But people with certain patterns are wayy more likely to cheat <This message was edited>
6/28/24, 1:15 AM - Sayanth: Yesss
6/28/24, 1:16 AM - Aishwarya: Oh 😢🫂🫡
6/28/24, 1:16 AM - Sayanth: Aishu u are not a green flag u are an entire green Forrest
6/28/24, 1:16 AM - Sayanth: 🥹
6/28/24, 1:16 AM - Sayanth: Stop being so green
6/28/24, 1:16 AM - Aishwarya: You are a gem for that 

Hope you get blessed with the right girl
6/28/24, 1:16 AM - Sayanth: I might fall for u at this rate
6/28/24, 1:16 AM - Sayanth: 😭
6/28/24, 1:17 AM - Sayanth: Me too
6/28/24, 1:18 AM - Aishwarya: I'm not a green flag or a red flag haha 
My character is based on how the other person is haha
6/28/24, 1:19 AM - Sayanth: Well I'm color blind I guess
6/28/24, 1:19 AM - Sayanth: I only see green
6/28/24, 1:21 AM - Sayanth: U don't have to write an essay 🫣
6/28/24, 1:23 AM - Aishwarya: 💀 lol no 
Hope that's a joke okay 😂
I mean it might be validating ,especially coz I find you cute 

But like please don't ruin the friendship 

And since you are so young ,cute  AND a good person , it will literally feel like I'm taking advantage of you ,coz you have lot of trauma 

Also looks wise, you have lot more looks than the base level looks I like in guys 
( I just said coz some guys think the girls friendzone them coz of their looks )


I just said in case ,coz you literally told me you got attached to that girl ,just coz of her personality
6/28/24, 1:25 AM - Sayanth: No I'm serious u are being sooo green so I might actually fall there's a chance
6/28/24, 1:25 AM - Aishwarya: Also ,the other day I had a passive thought , that you are single coz you have lot of trauma

Otherwise you won't be single and hence you won't be available to be friends
6/28/24, 1:26 AM - Sayanth: But since I already have a crush
6/28/24, 1:26 AM - Aishwarya: Please no 😑
6/28/24, 1:26 AM - Sayanth: I prolly won't
6/28/24, 1:26 AM - Aishwarya: Okay ,good
6/28/24, 1:26 AM - Aishwarya: Okay , that's good 
Keep it that way lol
6/28/24, 1:26 AM - Sayanth: Yeah yeah
6/28/24, 1:27 AM - Aishwarya: Even my pune friend 
After she gets into relationship, it will be different 🥺
6/28/24, 1:27 AM - Aishwarya: But it is what it is though
6/28/24, 1:27 AM - Sayanth: Oh come on don't think u are taking advantage of me ok
6/28/24, 1:28 AM - Sayanth: I won't leave u
6/28/24, 1:28 AM - Sayanth: Even if I get into a relationship
6/28/24, 1:28 AM - Aishwarya: But she won't anytime soon 
Coz she have to find a childfree guy to be in a serious relationship with
6/28/24, 1:28 AM - Aishwarya: Okay
6/28/24, 1:28 AM - Aishwarya: Okay I hope so 🥹
6/28/24, 1:29 AM - Aishwarya: Okay
6/28/24, 1:29 AM - Sayanth: I don't lie nor I'll promise thing i can't keep
6/28/24, 1:29 AM - Sayanth: So dw
6/28/24, 1:29 AM - Sayanth: U are a good friend
6/28/24, 1:30 AM - Sayanth: I don't feel this comfortable with most people
6/28/24, 1:30 AM - Aishwarya: Okay 🥹
I mean you don't have to available all the time after you get into relationship 

Just be there when I'm in need
( especially if I don't have a reliable friend during that time )
6/28/24, 1:30 AM - Aishwarya: Oh okay
6/28/24, 1:32 AM - Aishwarya: Like I told right ,the emergency situations 

That's the main time ,that I want someone to talk to
6/28/24, 1:32 AM - Sayanth: Oh come on you have been there for me

6/28/24, 1:33 AM - Aishwarya: Okay

Please feel free to reach out more if you feel anxious or just for any reason

6/28/24, 9:11 PM - Aishwarya: Ya true
6/28/24, 9:11 PM - Sayanth: May be I'm wrong but as far as I know it's not scientific
6/28/24, 9:11 PM - Aishwarya: Coz the planets change places all the time 
Etc
6/28/24, 9:11 PM - Aishwarya: Okay
6/28/24, 9:12 PM - Aishwarya: Somebody had told the reasons according to them ,why astrology is scam
Can't remember
6/28/24, 9:13 PM - Sayanth: I mean they do affect us in some ways like moons gravity affecting earth's water and all
6/28/24, 9:13 PM - Aishwarya: Ohh
6/28/24, 9:13 PM - Sayanth: And some planets gravity changing the trajectory of meteorites
6/28/24, 9:13 PM - Aishwarya: I mean like astrology 
The signs and the people
6/28/24, 9:14 PM - Aishwarya: Ya
6/28/24, 9:14 PM - Sayanth: Nah that's not scientific at all I think

6/28/24, 9:17 PM - Sayanth: 🥹
6/28/24, 9:17 PM - Aishwarya: Okay
6/28/24, 9:18 PM - Aishwarya: Okay

6/28/24, 9:18 PM - Aishwarya: No
6/28/24, 9:18 PM - Aishwarya: Do you have ?
6/28/24, 9:19 PM - Aishwarya: The time do you know ?
Your birth time?
6/28/24, 9:19 PM - Aishwarya: I think based on that ,it's written right ?
6/28/24, 9:19 PM - Aishwarya: My uncle had some dosham 
I think it was chovvadosham
6/28/24, 9:20 PM - Aishwarya: He married when he was 34 I think 
His wife was 26
6/28/24, 9:20 PM - Sayanth: Nope
6/28/24, 9:20 PM - Sayanth: My cousin has tho
6/28/24, 9:20 PM - Aishwarya: But the wife was not cute at all 
But he was
6/28/24, 9:20 PM - Sayanth: Nope
6/28/24, 9:20 PM - Sayanth: I guess mom knows
6/28/24, 9:21 PM - Sayanth: Yeah
6/28/24, 9:21 PM - Sayanth: Oh
6/28/24, 9:21 PM - Aishwarya: Even though he became kind of fat after 30
But in his early 20s atleast he was not fat 
And overall was attractive
6/28/24, 9:21 PM - Aishwarya: I think the dosham effected the marriage matches
6/28/24, 9:21 PM - Aishwarya: Okay
6/28/24, 9:22 PM - Sayanth: Yeah understandable
6/28/24, 9:22 PM - Aishwarya: Oh

6/29/24, 11:28 PM - Sayanth: How are you ?
6/29/24, 11:29 PM - Aishwarya: Oh , say no to what?
You already told about your feelings right ?

What happened after that ?

6/29/24, 11:29 PM - Aishwarya: I'm fine
6/29/24, 11:31 PM - Aishwarya: Btw did you ask for her instagram ?
6/29/24, 11:31 PM - Sayanth: She did gave me one
6/29/24, 11:31 PM - Sayanth: Like when we first met on reddit
6/29/24, 11:32 PM - Sayanth: But that's her alt
6/29/24, 11:32 PM - Sayanth: No she didn't say yes or no
6/29/24, 11:32 PM - Sayanth: Glad
6/29/24, 11:32 PM - Aishwarya: Oh she should have given you her main 
You gave her your main instagram right
6/29/24, 11:32 PM - Sayanth: Did u study today
6/29/24, 11:32 PM - Sayanth: ?
6/29/24, 11:32 PM - Sayanth: Yeah
6/29/24, 11:33 PM - Aishwarya: Ya
6/29/24, 11:34 PM - Aishwarya: Do you have her whatsapp? <This message was edited>
6/29/24, 11:34 PM - Sayanth: Nope
6/29/24, 11:34 PM - Sayanth: Nothing
6/29/24, 11:35 PM - Aishwarya: Ohh
6/29/24, 11:38 PM - Aishwarya: I think do it fast yk
6/29/24, 11:38 PM - Aishwarya: Get some clarity fast ?
6/29/24, 11:39 PM - Aishwarya: Imo that will be good for you
6/29/24, 11:48 PM - Sayanth: I'll have to cut contacts with her if she says no
6/29/24, 11:48 PM - Sayanth: And she will probably
6/29/24, 11:49 PM - Sayanth: I don't think I can see her as just a friend after that
6/29/24, 11:49 PM - Sayanth: Idk why
6/29/24, 11:49 PM - Sayanth: Or her being with someone else
6/29/24, 11:50 PM - Aishwarya: Yess
6/29/24, 11:50 PM - Aishwarya: Ya
For most people it's like that only I think
6/29/24, 11:51 PM - Aishwarya: Ya that is understandable
6/29/24, 11:51 PM - Aishwarya: So you will have to block her
6/29/24, 11:51 PM - Sayanth: It's totally upto her but that's gonna break me tho
6/29/24, 11:52 PM - Sayanth: That's why . I don't wanna block her or lose her even as a friend
6/29/24, 11:52 PM - Aishwarya: But if she say yes ,is a relationship possible ?
It's gonna be long distance relationship right 
Does it work for you and her?
6/29/24, 11:52 PM - Sayanth: For me yeah
6/29/24, 11:52 PM - Sayanth: For her idk
6/29/24, 11:53 PM - Aishwarya: Maybe ask her indirectly how she feel about long distance relationship 

Some people don't do long distance relationshop ,either coz it failed before for them ,or from some other friends experiences
6/29/24, 11:54 PM - Aishwarya: So if she say yes to you ,but she is someone who don't do long distance relationship 
Then you will be stuck on her still 
Since she didn't tell a clear no either
6/29/24, 11:54 PM - Aishwarya: Okay
6/29/24, 11:55 PM - Aishwarya: Ya , you should first ask her that 
Like indirectly 

In terms if her views 
If she ask why you are asking that ,tell her that you are just curious
6/29/24, 11:56 PM - Aishwarya: Ya , if you can continue being friends with her in the present situation that is going on 
But you told you are getting negative feeling about her flirting with others etc etc right 

Then yea maybe don't ask her out
6/29/24, 11:59 PM - Aishwarya: I mean if you can continue being friends with her peacefully 
And if she is that much good as a friend ,then maybe don't ask her out 

Otherwise ask her out ,get clarity 
If it's no ,block her 
If it's yes ,then continue
6/30/24, 12:00 AM - Sayanth: It's like that between devil and the deep blue see thing
6/30/24, 12:00 AM - Aishwarya: I think in your case, better to ask her if it's yes or no
6/30/24, 12:01 AM - Aishwarya: Coz you seem to be stuck on this , anxious about it everyday 
So get it out of your system 
Life is short yk
6/30/24, 12:01 AM - Aishwarya: What's that 
That quote in malayalam aano ?
6/30/24, 12:02 AM - Sayanth: Yeah

6/30/24, 12:06 AM - Aishwarya: And then next day ask her if it's yes or no

You are joking then
6/30/24, 10:51 PM - Sayanth: W8
6/30/24, 10:51 PM - Aishwarya: Heheh
6/30/24, 10:51 PM - Sayanth: So there's this theory of mine
6/30/24, 10:51 PM - Aishwarya: Oh
6/30/24, 10:51 PM - Aishwarya: What's that
6/30/24, 10:52 PM - Sayanth: Like u know metals conduct electricity right
6/30/24, 10:52 PM - Aishwarya: Ya
6/30/24, 10:52 PM - Sayanth: And all metals have some extend of resistance
6/30/24, 10:52 PM - Aishwarya: Ya
6/30/24, 10:53 PM - Sayanth: So metals that have high resistance conducts electricity it gets hotter
6/30/24, 10:53 PM - Sayanth: Like tungsten
6/30/24, 10:54 PM - Sayanth: Also if u are using metals like that to transfer information or data it'll be slower due to the resistance
6/30/24, 10:54 PM - Sayanth: So my theory states that
6/30/24, 10:54 PM - Sayanth: If you are slow that means you have a high resistance
6/30/24, 10:54 PM - Sayanth: Which means ?
6/30/24, 10:54 PM - Aishwarya: Ya
6/30/24, 10:54 PM - Sayanth: U fill it
6/30/24, 10:55 PM - Aishwarya: Send a voice note🤩 ,so that I can understand better 🥹
6/30/24, 10:55 PM - Aishwarya: Heheh
6/30/24, 10:55 PM - Sayanth: Ok let me make it simple
6/30/24, 10:56 PM - Aishwarya: Okay
6/30/24, 10:56 PM - Sayanth: Slower it gets the more temperature it emits
6/30/24, 10:56 PM - Sayanth: So u are ?
6/30/24, 10:56 PM - Sayanth: If u are slow what does that mean ?
6/30/24, 10:57 PM - Aishwarya: Let me think
6/30/24, 10:57 PM - Sayanth: Yessss
6/30/24, 10:58 PM - Aishwarya: 💀

6/30/24, 10:59 PM - Sayanth: That was a compliment
6/30/24, 10:59 PM - Aishwarya: Oh got it 🥹😂
6/30/24, 10:59 PM - Sayanth: I was indirectly saying you are hot
6/30/24, 10:59 PM - Sayanth: Cuz u are slow
6/30/24, 10:59 PM - Aishwarya: 🤣nice
6/30/24, 10:59 PM - Sayanth: More resistance
6/30/24, 10:59 PM - Sayanth: So more heat emission
6/30/24, 10:59 PM - Aishwarya: Ya got it
6/30/24, 10:59 PM - Aishwarya: How do you invent such stuff 🥹
6/30/24, 10:59 PM - Sayanth: Well theory is true tho

7/2/24, 1:39 AM - Aishwarya: Okay
7/2/24, 1:43 AM - Aishwarya: Nice song
7/2/24, 1:45 AM - Aishwarya: People sometimes like songs more, when they relate with it 
But not always ofcourse
7/2/24, 1:45 AM - Sayanth: Yessss
7/2/24, 1:46 AM - Aishwarya: You can relate to this song in a fun way 
Like crazy is cool <This message was edited>
7/2/24, 1:46 AM - Aishwarya: Like crazy to me means people can do whatever they want as long as they are not harming anyone 
That way <This message was edited>

7/2/24, 1:49 AM - Sayanth: Goodnight
7/2/24, 1:50 AM - Aishwarya: Like I think sometimes crazy has negative annotations also 
Like people calling others 

The guy i told about, he called his exes crazy for example 

This can be a parent calling kids that etc
7/2/24, 1:51 AM - Aishwarya: But I just wanted to say that you have a calming vibe about you 🤔
Probably it's coz I don't know you much
7/2/24, 1:51 AM - Sayanth: Well ask me what u wanna know
7/2/24, 1:52 AM - Sayanth: U know pretty much everything about me kinda
7/2/24, 1:53 AM - Aishwarya: Oh I meant since you send me the song crazy 

I thought you liked the song 
coz somebody called you that or something 😅

Like the songs in sad playlist
7/2/24, 1:53 AM - Aishwarya: So I meant to say you have actually a calming vibe 😅
7/2/24, 1:53 AM - Sayanth: Well people always call me crazy
7/2/24, 1:53 AM - Aishwarya: Idk if that makes sense 😂
7/2/24, 1:53 AM - Aishwarya: Ohh
7/2/24, 1:53 AM - Sayanth: But I like that
7/2/24, 1:54 AM - Sayanth: Thankssss🥹🥹🥹
7/2/24, 1:54 AM - Sayanth: U tooo
7/2/24, 1:54 AM - Aishwarya: Oh that is what I meant to ask 
Like I had some 5 percent doubt if someone called you crazy
7/2/24, 1:54 AM - Sayanth: Actually I wanted to say that last day
7/2/24, 1:55 AM - Aishwarya: Okay then 😄

7/2/24, 1:56 AM - Aishwarya: So , don't take it to the heart
If someone did call you that
7/2/24, 1:56 AM - Sayanth: Means a lot

7/2/24, 11:36 PM - Sayanth: Hiiiii
7/2/24, 11:37 PM - Aishwarya: Heyy
7/2/24, 11:37 PM - Aishwarya: I was reading chats in a group I'm in
7/2/24, 11:37 PM - Sayanth: Oh
7/2/24, 11:37 PM - Sayanth: Whats it about
7/2/24, 11:37 PM - Aishwarya: There was a girl who i didn't like the vibe initially of
7/2/24, 11:37 PM - Aishwarya: Turns out I don't like her even more 
I saw some of her messages today
7/2/24, 11:38 PM - Aishwarya: One min
7/2/24, 11:38 PM - Aishwarya: You know what happened today?
There is this guy who has been texting me on and off, and seems to be into me. He has a problem of mansplaining,  and when I say I know, he will say oh I forgot you are doing Phd 🤣🤣🤣
Anyway, he is a nutritionist and a coach. We met in a fitness group only. So I was joking to my fiance that I should ask him to make me a diet plan for free since he wants to get into my pants so bad, that guy only texted me
My fiance kept saying how unethical it is to take "advantage" of this guy and his feelings, so I was like maybe he is right, and told this guy that I am getting married
And mentioned how I have to get in shape. He replied, LETS GET YOU IN SHAPE
????? Like I didn't ask you?????
Anyway he was like send me your measurements
And I was like okay creepy, so I kept putting it off
Today morning he again asked for pictures and measurements
YOU KNOW WHAT HE ASKS??
"Do you feel sexual urges during periods"
7/2/24, 11:38 PM - Aishwarya: Her messages
7/2/24, 11:38 PM - Aishwarya: I was talking to my pune friend about it
7/2/24, 11:39 PM - Sayanth: Oh
7/2/24, 11:39 PM - Sayanth: She getting married
7/2/24, 11:40 PM - Aishwarya: <Media omitted>
7/2/24, 11:40 PM - Aishwarya: Ya
7/2/24, 11:41 PM - Sayanth: Ah agree with the other person
7/2/24, 11:42 PM - Aishwarya: <Media omitted>
7/2/24, 11:42 PM - Aishwarya: Ya
7/2/24, 11:44 PM - Sayanth: Damn
7/2/24, 11:44 PM - Aishwarya: <Media omitted>
7/2/24, 11:45 PM - Sayanth: Wtf
7/2/24, 11:45 PM - Aishwarya: Yea
7/2/24, 11:47 PM - Aishwarya: <Media omitted>
7/2/24, 11:48 PM - Aishwarya: I had some off feeling about this girl
7/2/24, 11:49 PM - Aishwarya: I told you before about a girl in the group I liked right 
Have to check what she replied to all that
7/2/24, 11:49 PM - Aishwarya: I hope she refrained from engaging in that conversation
7/2/24, 11:50 PM - Aishwarya: It's not really possible to check a person in a group without creating a fight 

But can choose to not enable bs though
7/3/24, 12:01 AM - Sayanth: I agree with her when u put a group of similar people together somehow they start to be hateful
7/3/24, 12:01 AM - Sayanth: Be it men or women
7/3/24, 12:01 AM - Aishwarya: Ya
7/3/24, 12:01 AM - Aishwarya: This is a mental health group
7/3/24, 12:02 AM - Aishwarya: She was talking about other women's groups in general 
Ofcourse mens groups too
7/3/24, 12:04 AM - Aishwarya: In this group three women were replying to her 
Telling her to block him 

But like none were saying its lowkey cheating 
If that makes sense 
Which I didn't like coz I expected better from them
7/3/24, 12:07 AM - Aishwarya: Also it depends on the relationship boundaries 
Since her husband is aware of this ,it's not cheating per say 
It's just like how most men lust after other women while in relationship 
So I don't really condone it 

Imo men giving other women sexual attention is similar to women receiving sexual attention from other men 
I can't say she is doing something wrong without seeing how her husband is 
( if her husband is also a flirt I don't see anything wrong with it)

But I would not want to be friends with such people though 
Not my vibe 
And I don't really like them or their vibe either
7/3/24, 12:09 AM - Aishwarya: Since she has a fiance and entertains other men ,what the hell was she expecting

And to post about it in group to seek validation that she didn't do any wrong 

This group is a mental health space 
Not for bs like this 😑
7/3/24, 12:14 AM - Aishwarya: Hey btw feel free to disagree 
😂 
I just wanted to vent a bit
7/3/24, 12:14 AM - Aishwarya: I was gonna text the admin girl about it 💀
I have barely texted her anything before , apart from asking about some mental health page links
7/3/24, 12:15 AM - Aishwarya: I need to chill
7/3/24, 12:15 AM - Aishwarya: I checked ,she didn't reply to those conversations 

She did send some messages in some other group 
So she was online
7/3/24, 12:17 AM - Aishwarya: I mean the girl in the group, that girls relationship I meant 
It's not cheating
7/3/24, 12:18 AM - Aishwarya: But she is a big red flag ofcourse 

Future actual cheater girl 

And the guy doesn't deserve it ,coz he is a good guy
7/3/24, 12:29 AM - Sayanth: Hey
7/3/24, 12:29 AM - Sayanth: I'll reply morning ok
7/3/24, 12:29 AM - Sayanth: Sorry I'm not in a good state
7/3/24, 12:30 AM - Sayanth: Will talk to you later
7/3/24, 12:30 AM - Sayanth: She said No 🙂
7/3/24, 12:30 AM - Sayanth: So I guess u can understand
7/3/24, 12:30 AM - Sayanth: Goodnight
7/3/24, 12:30 AM - Sayanth: Take care ok
7/3/24, 12:41 AM - Aishwarya: Okay no worries
7/3/24, 12:41 AM - Aishwarya: Ya
7/3/24, 12:43 AM - Aishwarya: Oh okay

It is going to be okay 
Don't stress about it

7/4/24, 11:39 PM - Sayanth: 2) you do have inferiority complex tbh and you think of yourself as not good looking which is funny cuz u look totally attractive from my pov so don't think of yourself as inferior be it physically or mentally
7/4/24, 11:39 PM - Aishwarya: Okayy😄
7/4/24, 11:40 PM - Aishwarya: Okay 🥹
Thank you ma friend 😇
7/4/24, 11:40 PM - Sayanth: 3) idk tbh I'll ask later I guess lemme think that
7/4/24, 11:40 PM - Aishwarya: Okay
7/4/24, 11:42 PM - Sayanth: 4) well no I've been an open book to you . So from my side nothing I do trust you. And care for you so yeah I'm more worried if there's anything that I'm doing that's making u uncomfortable
7/4/24, 11:42 PM - Sayanth: <Media omitted>
7/4/24, 11:43 PM - Aishwarya: Okay then 😄

Oh ,from my side also nothing 😄
7/4/24, 11:44 PM - Sayanth: 5) well I guess we should call and may be meet some time in the future once both of us are comfortable enough to do that. But rn I'm good I don't want you hide anything or lie about something for any reasons even if it's something that's gonna hurt me I don't want u to lie
7/4/24, 11:45 PM - Aishwarya: Btw do you feel like it is easier to say about mistakes of guys than girls in friendships ?

But I think it depends
7/4/24, 11:47 PM - Aishwarya: I like you so much as a person, so nothing to say
Atleast as of now 

(I'm an open person , so if I don't like something, usually I say that ,instead of keeping it in mind )

You are a good friend
7/4/24, 11:48 PM - Aishwarya: Okayy😄
7/4/24, 11:49 PM - Sayanth: <Media omitted>
7/4/24, 11:50 PM - Sayanth: Idk tbh
7/4/24, 11:52 PM - Aishwarya: You said this 😄

So I think there won't be some time in future, that I find out something about you that I don't know hehe 

I just wanted to be sure 
So I asked

7/5/24, 11:40 PM - Aishwarya: Okay
7/5/24, 11:41 PM - Aishwarya: Idk about girls 
I feel women are better in general 
Atleast in terms of relationships red flags
7/5/24, 11:45 PM - Aishwarya: Anyways I know that its not that I like red flags 
It's just that what is available atleast for me 
And also in general 
Coz many women complain about this I guess 
That I meant

7/7/24, 12:35 AM - Aishwarya: Okay
7/7/24, 12:36 AM - Aishwarya: That's good

7/7/24, 12:38 AM - Sayanth: Yessss
7/7/24, 12:38 AM - Aishwarya: Athipo engane choithikum🤔
7/7/24, 12:38 AM - Sayanth: U may ask my lord
7/7/24, 12:39 AM - Aishwarya: Are you actively searching for a relationship ?
I'm asking coz after that you will be less available right 
I was thinking if this friendship will last till next year
7/7/24, 12:40 AM - Aishwarya: But future predict cheyyan pattilla
7/7/24, 12:40 AM - Sayanth: Nah I'm not looking for a relationship
7/7/24, 12:40 AM - Sayanth: If it happens it happens

7/7/24, 12:41 AM - Sayanth: Yesss totally
7/7/24, 12:41 AM - Aishwarya: I see 

But relationships happen like that only rarely though 

So that means chances are less 
Ennu ashwasikam🥹😂
7/7/24, 12:43 AM - Aishwarya: I don't wanna get married 

After I pass my exams ,I want to date someone 
Maybe a relationship 
Bcoz I have to check it off the list ,coz I have major fomo 

And then after one year, I have to prepare for another exam 💀 to leave india
Full buzy aayirikum
7/7/24, 12:44 AM - Aishwarya: Okayy
7/7/24, 12:44 AM - Aishwarya: Hm ithokke kure ketit und 🥲
But yea I hope so
7/7/24, 12:44 AM - Sayanth: Njn povula
7/7/24, 12:44 AM - Sayanth: 🫂🫂🫂
7/7/24, 12:45 AM - Sayanth: U are gonna leave that's what scares me
7/7/24, 12:45 AM - Sayanth: 🥹😭
7/7/24, 12:46 AM - Aishwarya: I feel happier during the day when I have a friend i like 
Pune friend I like ,but I don't have the space to talk about my traumas with her 
Or about my emotions that day
7/7/24, 12:46 AM - Aishwarya: We just share memes and stuff 
It's kind of a trauma bonding with me and her
7/7/24, 12:47 AM - Aishwarya: Not trauma bonding 
But very lowkey
7/7/24, 12:47 AM - Aishwarya: Okay 🙂
I hope so
7/7/24, 12:48 AM - Sayanth: Dw
7/7/24, 12:49 AM - Aishwarya: Yes my main dream is to leave india 
But you will find other friends, you have a good vibe about you 

Plus you are a cutie 😄
7/7/24, 12:50 AM - Sayanth: Nooo I don't wanna leave you 🥹🥺
7/7/24, 12:51 AM - Aishwarya: Don't judge okay 
Its like me and my pune friend used to bond over sharing memes about childfree things 
A part of that is how much the world sucks etc
And I feel like that coz I'm mentally not so happy 
So I feel like she dont want me to be that happy yk 

In the sense , she believes in the ideology called antinatalism 
I don't 

I don't want kids due to personal reasons only <This message was edited>
7/7/24, 12:52 AM - Sayanth: Yeah I get it
7/7/24, 12:52 AM - Sayanth: It's totally ok
7/7/24, 12:53 AM - Aishwarya: Idk if you are joking 😅

But yea you told you get attached to people fast 
So you probably actually feel sad about it
7/7/24, 12:53 AM - Aishwarya: Oh okay
7/7/24, 12:53 AM - Sayanth: I'm dead serious 🥹
7/7/24, 12:56 AM - Aishwarya: Ohh 
I can't believe it, coz I'm not like that 

I'm mostly detached from everyone ,to a point 
In the sense, I know that even friendships end ,I have accepted that 

But at the same time I have so much dependency on some people 
Coz I know if they leave and I don't get another friend, my days will be sadder
7/7/24, 12:57 AM - Sayanth: Idk I Don't want to lose u. I don't wanna leave you
7/7/24, 12:57 AM - Sayanth: Seriously tho
7/7/24, 12:58 AM - Aishwarya: I have told my pune friend about my trauma related to my dad 
But she said why do women have kids with shitty men ( this is a topic me and her have discussed so many times)

But she was not interested in how I feel personally if that makes sense 
That vibe was not there 😭
I feel that is because, she thinks that if I'm healed fully I might consider having kids
7/7/24, 1:02 AM - Aishwarya: Ohh 🥹
But yk many girls are very caring ,especially in relationships 
So once you find that ,you will no longer have any need for me 🥲💀

But that's totally okay 

So idk how the friendship will be then ,especially coz most girls don't prefer their boyfriend having opposite gender friends ( idk)

But you told you that won't get into relationship soon with anyone, so the friendship will be there for some time 
I hope so 🥹🥹🥹
7/7/24, 1:03 AM - Sayanth: Oh come on I'm not getting anyone soon .
7/7/24, 1:04 AM - Sayanth: I won't leave you no matter what
7/7/24, 1:06 AM - Sayanth: She's seeing it through a totally different lens may be too into that ideology
7/7/24, 1:06 AM - Aishwarya: Okay 🥹

Also I'm sorry for being lowkey happy for this 💀😭

For a moment I felt like a burden for feeling like that 🥲
But like it's not my fault ,my parents shouldn't gave given me so much trauma 
Or else I would have atleast one of them as friend
7/7/24, 1:06 AM - Aishwarya: Okay 🥹
7/7/24, 1:08 AM - Aishwarya: Ya she is a good person 
But I didn't feel the space to share my personal things with her 
One reason is because she never relied on me for that ( she don't really have much family problems ,plus she lives away from home )
7/7/24, 1:09 AM - Sayanth: It's ok I don't need anyone when u are there 🥹
7/7/24, 1:10 AM - Aishwarya: Also I had searched for other female friendships to be each others emotional support 
Coz they can still be friends after they get in relationship ( but they will get buzier though)

But it's luck also to find them 
And for the vibe to be there
7/7/24, 1:11 AM - Aishwarya: Okay🥹 I'm glad that I'm contributing something 

Feel free to message me whenever you need to talk
7/7/24, 1:11 AM - Sayanth: 🫂💜
7/7/24, 1:11 AM - Aishwarya: 🫂😇🥹
7/7/24, 1:12 AM - Sayanth: But I'm still scared about u leaving
7/7/24, 1:13 AM - Aishwarya: Ohh
7/7/24, 1:13 AM - Aishwarya: Dont judge 
But I lowkey felt like you are lying 
( I know it doesn't make sense )
7/7/24, 1:14 AM - Aishwarya: About this
7/7/24, 1:14 AM - Aishwarya: You know my previous guy friend ,he knew that I'm very vulnerable and I really needed a friend
7/7/24, 1:14 AM - Sayanth: No I really don't want to leave you 🥹
7/7/24, 1:15 AM - Aishwarya: And I just told him to be there with me till my exams are over 
He told he will be there forever ( which I didn't even need ; want yes )
7/7/24, 1:16 AM - Sayanth: Yeah well I've attachment issues so dw
7/7/24, 1:16 AM - Aishwarya: And then he later turnt the opposite 
Gave me hopes that he will be there as a friend
7/7/24, 1:16 AM - Aishwarya: Okay 🥹
7/7/24, 1:16 AM - Aishwarya: Okay
7/7/24, 1:20 AM - Aishwarya: Actually I didn't even care about , if he will be there forever or not
I just wanted a reliable friend till my exams are over 

But why did he promise all that then😑 ,idk 

What I meant is ,it gave me additional trust issues 💀
7/7/24, 1:21 AM - Sayanth: It's ok I can understand
7/7/24, 1:21 AM - Aishwarya: But ofcourse ,everyone would want to be forever friends with a good friend 
Me too
7/7/24, 1:22 AM - Aishwarya: Coz a lot of people either suck or are not the vibe 

So good friends are gem
7/7/24, 1:22 AM - Aishwarya: Okay 🙂
7/7/24, 1:22 AM - Sayanth: I meant the trust issues
7/7/24, 1:23 AM - Aishwarya: Ya
7/7/24, 1:23 AM - Aishwarya: I understood
7/7/24, 1:23 AM - Sayanth: I won't leave you no matter what 🥹 seriously.  I won't . I need you more than you need me
7/7/24, 1:25 AM - Aishwarya: Really ? 🥹

Why am I smiling for this 💀

Okay, I'm glad that I'm contributing to the friendship 🥹🥹
7/7/24, 1:25 AM - Sayanth: Yesss
7/7/24, 1:25 AM - Aishwarya: Okay 🥹😄
7/7/24, 7:58 PM - Aishwarya: Hey
7/7/24, 7:58 PM - Aishwarya: How are you today ?
7/7/24, 8:09 PM - Sayanth: A bittt
7/7/24, 8:09 PM - Sayanth: Bad
7/7/24, 8:09 PM - Sayanth: 6/10
7/7/24, 8:09 PM - Aishwarya: Oh
7/7/24, 8:09 PM - Sayanth: Hbu
7/7/24, 8:10 PM - Aishwarya: What happened?
7/7/24, 8:10 PM - Sayanth: Nothing particular just the crush situation I guess
7/7/24, 8:10 PM - Aishwarya: It was okay to good 
Usual
7/7/24, 8:10 PM - Sayanth: Oh
7/7/24, 8:10 PM - Sayanth: Did u go out
7/7/24, 8:10 PM - Sayanth: .
?
7/7/24, 8:10 PM - Aishwarya: Oh 
What about that ?
Did you message her again?
7/7/24, 8:11 PM - Aishwarya: No
7/7/24, 8:11 PM - Aishwarya: Btw why she said no
7/7/24, 8:11 PM - Aishwarya: I forgot to ask
7/7/24, 8:11 PM - Sayanth: Idk
7/7/24, 8:11 PM - Aishwarya: You are a cutie 🥹
7/7/24, 8:11 PM - Sayanth: She just said we are never meant to be like that
7/7/24, 8:11 PM - Aishwarya: There must be some reason for no
7/7/24, 8:11 PM - Sayanth: I'm not
7/7/24, 8:11 PM - Aishwarya: Are you secretly a red flag ?
7/7/24, 8:11 PM - Aishwarya: Jk
7/7/24, 8:12 PM - Sayanth: May be
7/7/24, 8:12 PM - Aishwarya: Ohh okay 
Long distance relationships usually don't work 
Probably that ?
7/7/24, 8:12 PM - Sayanth: I guess being too nice gets u in the friendzone
7/7/24, 8:12 PM - Aishwarya: Ohh 
Why you think ,maybe
7/7/24, 8:12 PM - Sayanth: Well idk tbh cuz she Said No to me .
7/7/24, 8:14 PM - Aishwarya: Noooo
That's not trueeee

Usually guys get friendzoned if the girl is not attracted to him though, like that all 
Or if the girl is very cute and knows she can get a cuter guy than him maybe 

But not coz the guy is nice though
7/7/24, 8:17 PM - Aishwarya: Like generally 

In your case idk 
Maybe she has some different physical preferences 
Or maybe she thinks that you are too good for her ?( probably coz you are better looking than her, or some other reason)

Or probably the long distance 

Or probably she already likes someone else 

Definitely not coz of being too nice etc 
Please don't change that about your personality in future ,thinking it's coz of that
7/7/24, 8:18 PM - Aishwarya: I have seen in some dating advice forums , guys telling other guys that girls don't like nice guys 
And telling them to be not like that 
Hence why I told 

That's totally not true
7/7/24, 8:20 PM - Aishwarya: But should have boundaries though 
And self respect 
Like there should be balance
7/7/24, 8:41 PM - Aishwarya: <Media omitted>
7/7/24, 8:48 PM - Aishwarya: Helloooo
7/7/24, 8:48 PM - Sayanth: w88888

This episode was like at least 5 therapy sessions crunched into one.

I have listened interviews of Lindsay Gibson earlier, but none of them were so compassionate, sprinkled with very pertinent questions by Hanson and occasional humour

7/7/24, 11:08 PM - Aishwarya: Btw
7/7/24, 11:08 PM - Aishwarya: I was sad for a moment related to something that happened at home
7/7/24, 11:09 PM - Sayanth: What was it
7/7/24, 11:09 PM - Aishwarya: Now I'm okay
7/7/24, 11:09 PM - Sayanth: Oh dqm fk
7/7/24, 11:09 PM - Sayanth: Tell me dear
7/7/24, 11:09 PM - Aishwarya: Okay 🥹
7/7/24, 11:11 PM - Aishwarya: Like my dad readjusted his lungi in living room 
And I was in the dining room 
I have no idea if he did it on purpose 
He was not facing me though 
And there was a curtain between us , which I hadn't fully closed 
Also I purposefully dont look towards his direction always
7/7/24, 11:12 PM - Aishwarya: And then he offed the tv and went to his room
7/7/24, 11:12 PM - Aishwarya: And then I told my mom about it
7/7/24, 11:12 PM - Aishwarya: I was gonna cry while talking to her about it 
She told she will tell him about it ,not to repeat it again
7/7/24, 11:13 PM - Aishwarya: And then after 3 minutes ,I started crying a bit and went upstairs and came to my room
7/7/24, 11:14 PM - Aishwarya: I had told him not to use the lungi to wipe his face before , two weeks ago 
He hasn't repeated it again ,yet
7/7/24, 11:14 PM - Aishwarya: But this is also a similar thing 
Isn't it obvious
7/7/24, 11:16 PM - Sayanth: I don't want u to cry ok
7/7/24, 11:16 PM - Aishwarya: Last time I got so mad and angry related to something and had created a scene in my home 😅( I threw some food that my mom made in garbage)
This time I just cried
7/7/24, 11:16 PM - Aishwarya: Okay 🙂
7/7/24, 11:18 PM - Sayanth: Ok I kinda get it . I don't think he did it intentionally as in to make u feel uncomfortable
7/7/24, 11:18 PM - Aishwarya: Something similar had happened and my dad told that if I don't like all this ,then why I'm not leaving yet 
And putting blame on me,
So thats why
7/7/24, 11:18 PM - Sayanth: Yeah same thing njnum kettu
7/7/24, 11:18 PM - Sayanth: But your side is valid
7/7/24, 11:19 PM - Aishwarya: Okay 
Do you dislike me a bit now, coz of what i did ?🥲 
Tell honestly 🙂
7/7/24, 11:19 PM - Sayanth: Sometimes we gotta adjust with others since we are living with their money we got no other choice
7/7/24, 11:19 PM - Aishwarya: Okay
7/7/24, 11:19 PM - Sayanth: Nooo
7/7/24, 11:19 PM - Sayanth: Whyyy
7/7/24, 11:19 PM - Aishwarya: Yaaa that I know
7/7/24, 11:19 PM - Sayanth: Why would I dislike you
7/7/24, 11:19 PM - Aishwarya: Ya
7/7/24, 11:20 PM - Aishwarya: Thank you for understanding 🥹
7/7/24, 11:20 PM - Aishwarya: Yaa 
I just asked , just in case 

Some people who grew up with healthy or loving parents view it differently
7/7/24, 11:21 PM - Sayanth: See I like you . And nothing is gonna change that ok dw about that at all
7/7/24, 11:21 PM - Aishwarya: Although I haven't really met anyone who really said what I did was wrong though
7/7/24, 11:21 PM - Sayanth: If there's something I'd rather try to correct it
7/7/24, 11:22 PM - Aishwarya: Okay 😭
7/7/24, 11:23 PM - Aishwarya: Okay🥹

7/7/24, 11:24 PM - Sayanth: I don't want to
7/7/24, 11:24 PM - Aishwarya: I don't know if I should say this 

But thinking that I have you as my friend now, made me recover more fast 🥹
7/7/24, 11:24 PM - Sayanth: Oh that's nice to hear 🫂🫂🫂💜

7/7/24, 11:25 PM - Aishwarya: Okay

7/7/24, 11:27 PM - Sayanth: Do you think I'd find someone who's more emotionally available and prettier than you ?
7/7/24, 11:28 PM - Aishwarya: Yes ofcourse 
But I hope you don't find that anytime soon 😭
7/7/24, 11:28 PM - Sayanth: No I won't find Someone like that
7/7/24, 11:28 PM - Sayanth: Well I've you why need someone else
7/7/24, 11:28 PM - Aishwarya: You are still so young , so you can just flirt with girls instead of committing to a relationship yk
7/7/24, 11:29 PM - Aishwarya: You can commit to that girl after you graduate college 😄
7/7/24, 11:30 PM - Sayanth: Hm yeah but I prefer talking to you
7/7/24, 11:30 PM - Sayanth: Also there's no such girl
7/7/24, 11:31 PM - Aishwarya: I mean when you find her 
Or happen to find her 

You said that presently you travel from college to home via college bus 
So you probably won't meet her unless from dating app
7/7/24, 11:31 PM - Sayanth: Yeah
7/7/24, 11:33 PM - Aishwarya: Anyways please don't leave me before I find another friend like you 😅
7/7/24, 11:33 PM - Sayanth: But I've no hope of finding someone from dating apps

7/7/24, 11:33 PM - Sayanth: I won't leave you
7/7/24, 11:33 PM - Sayanth: And I don't want u to find another friend
7/7/24, 11:34 PM - Sayanth: I'll be there if u ever need me
7/7/24, 11:34 PM - Aishwarya: I feel like if you commit to a relationship, that is bound to happen 
You are too young to commit imo 😄
7/7/24, 11:34 PM - Aishwarya: Okay 😄

7/7/24, 11:39 PM - Aishwarya: Don't give me so much promise which is not believable 
😅

I feel like ,you will drift apart from me, after you get into a relationship, which is okayyyyyy
7/7/24, 11:40 PM - Aishwarya: I will be there for you also as your friend
7/7/24, 11:43 PM - Aishwarya: Also ,yk

7/8/24, 9:33 PM - Aishwarya: In my college I used to wear tops or tshirts and jeans coz it was a city 
Of different colors
7/8/24, 9:34 PM - Aishwarya: I wanna move back to a city to wear all that again🥹
7/8/24, 9:35 PM - Aishwarya: <Media omitted>

7/8/24, 9:50 PM - Aishwarya: This was in february

7/8/24, 10:02 PM - Aishwarya: <Media omitted>

Not the creepy one
7/8/24, 11:53 PM - Aishwarya: I think it's coz makeup gives my face more contrast 
I had few hater girls in college coz of that 
Telling I look different with makeup 
I used to use it only sometimes though and after college I stopped using it
7/8/24, 11:56 PM - Aishwarya: And one of the reasons why I don't go outside much after I shifted here is because ,Im afraid of being SA'd 
It's the worse for girls who don't look attractive 😢
7/8/24, 11:57 PM - Aishwarya: Like I'm afraid someone will do that and ask eww who would do that to you 😭
So I won't even be able to stand up for myself 
Double trauma
7/9/24, 12:00 AM - Aishwarya: I try to go in ladies compartment in train for example ( the few times that I traveled alone ) ; and my parents and even bro told that why are you taking so many precautions
7/9/24, 12:01 AM - Aishwarya: But at the same time ,these same people will look down on women who have been victims of SA related stuff 
Atleast in cities, it's less like that
7/9/24, 12:02 AM - Aishwarya: Especially in the liberal countries

Although I don't really like him anymore coz of the resentment
7/10/24, 11:04 PM - Aishwarya: But I check his new following 
Gotta remember how most guys are 
Its an ispiration for me to get out of this country
7/10/24, 11:06 PM - Aishwarya: I be forgetting it coz of the positivity bias 

Most of my few guy friends and acquaintances are not like that ,but that's not majority though
7/10/24, 11:11 PM - Aishwarya: College also I kind of forgot the bad experiences 
Being naive is not good 
Atha udheshiche
7/10/24, 11:12 PM - Aishwarya: I told you before I think
7/10/24, 11:12 PM - Aishwarya: One guy in my college , slut shamed me 💀

7/10/24, 11:13 PM - Aishwarya: Meanwhile him ,he is the hoe😑
7/10/24, 11:13 PM - Aishwarya: He was literally disrespecting his girlfriend even 😢
7/10/24, 11:14 PM - Sayanth: Why
7/10/24, 11:14 PM - Sayanth: Wtf
7/10/24, 11:14 PM - Sayanth: Whyyyy

7/10/24, 11:15 PM - Aishwarya: He send me 💦 emoji and then recalled it 
Coz I was flirting with a senior😭
That too just on text 
It was subtle even ,not straight up stuff 
And also just one sentence
7/10/24, 11:16 PM - Sayanth: Yeah I remember it now
7/10/24, 11:16 PM - Aishwarya: Yaa
7/10/24, 11:16 PM - Sayanth: U had mentioned it before
7/10/24, 11:16 PM - Aishwarya: Okay
7/10/24, 11:16 PM - Aishwarya: Yaa
7/10/24, 11:16 PM - Aishwarya: Plus
7/10/24, 11:16 PM - Aishwarya: One girl was literally roastedddd in a group of 100 people 😢
7/10/24, 11:17 PM - Sayanth: Whyyy
7/10/24, 11:17 PM - Aishwarya: Coz she broke up with a guy and went with another guy from the same class 
Which is wrong kinda

but imo breakups happen
7/10/24, 11:18 PM - Aishwarya: Meanwhileeee
7/10/24, 11:18 PM - Aishwarya: My classmates helped a guy who was in a relationship with a girl from our class , try prostitute 🙂
7/10/24, 11:19 PM - Aishwarya: The doubleee standardsss💀😢
7/10/24, 11:20 PM - Aishwarya: Calling her vedi, padakkam etc etc
posting her and her ex together pics ,on her birthday
7/10/24, 11:21 PM - Aishwarya: Actually even the ex guy understood and was okay with the breakup ,kinda

It was his friends who had a major problem and created so much drama
7/10/24, 11:23 PM - Aishwarya: Alsoo btww this ex guy 

Unrelated but he is my second crush in college 

He also did wrongings btw
Taking advantage for example
7/10/24, 11:25 PM - Aishwarya: What meant is such stuff happens 

Although me, I haven't done people wrong that way, but I can't flex that coz I'm not attractive 😂
But just said
7/10/24, 11:26 PM - Aishwarya: What I meant is that in conservative places ,girls are at lottt more disadvantage
7/10/24, 11:27 PM - Aishwarya: In the sense, they are judged for every little thing
7/10/24, 11:28 PM - Sayanth: U are attractive 😑
7/10/24, 11:28 PM - Aishwarya: Meanwhile my crush at the time was sexting another girl 💀
And not even giving me much attention
7/10/24, 11:28 PM - Sayanth: Yup
7/10/24, 11:28 PM - Aishwarya: You are so sweet😭🥺🥹

God bless you 🥹
7/10/24, 11:29 PM - Aishwarya: Btwwww
7/10/24, 11:29 PM - Aishwarya: Your college was not in city right
7/10/24, 11:30 PM - Aishwarya: But I remember one of school mates story 
Their college wasn't city
7/10/24, 11:31 PM - Aishwarya: One guy his ex left him for another guy  ; and he and his friends was slut shaming her in a group 

What she did is not right though
7/10/24, 11:31 PM - Sayanth: Nope
7/10/24, 11:33 PM - Aishwarya: But here is the catch 
This guy used to flirt with me rarely while he was in relationship 

Being friends with girls while in relationship is okay 
But flirting is not 

Alsooo, I didn't know about many things before I was 25
So I didn't even realize something back then
7/10/24, 11:34 PM - Aishwarya: Like I used to talk to him rarely coz I was in contact with only three guys after i went to college
7/10/24, 11:35 PM - Sayanth: Well I was a late bloomer as well
7/10/24, 11:35 PM - Aishwarya: In that one guy was very decent 

The one guy is paavam but not so decent though

Both of them were single btw
7/10/24, 11:36 PM - Aishwarya: Yaa, you have told 
But idk how guys can be like that 
But it's okay
7/10/24, 11:39 PM - Aishwarya: Sooo how is it in your college btw 
I think genz girls are more liberal and powerful sort of ,but idk about non cities though
7/10/24, 11:40 PM - Sayanth: Hmmm it's tbh idk
7/10/24, 11:40 PM - Sayanth: Yeah liberal
7/10/24, 11:40 PM - Aishwarya: Okay
7/10/24, 11:40 PM - Aishwarya: Oh okay
7/10/24, 11:40 PM - Sayanth: But nothing like you mentioned
7/10/24, 11:40 PM - Sayanth: No drama here
7/10/24, 11:41 PM - Sayanth: Like nothing at all
7/10/24, 11:41 PM - Aishwarya: Yaa I thought so for some reason 
Kinda makes sense
7/10/24, 11:41 PM - Aishwarya: That's good
7/10/24, 11:41 PM - Sayanth: Yuppp
7/11/24, 7:42 PM - Aishwarya: Heyyyyyy

7/11/24, 8:30 PM - Sayanth: Yes usually all days except Sunday

7/11/24, 9:49 PM - Aishwarya: I told him that the friend replied 🥹

And asked him also if I'm annoying 💀
He is the friend who used to listen to my long rants 
The friend who I had a fall out with at some point

7/11/24, 10:02 PM - Aishwarya: Alsoo 
Please dont think I'm a drama person 😅( just in case )
Coz I told another friend about a friend, but they don't know each other so it's alright I think 

Actually I had thought of gatekeeping new friends coz of nazar
7/11/24, 10:06 PM - Aishwarya: There was something that happened on 21st June and I had misunderstood you ( something minor kind of )
So I had messaged my pune friend about it and then recalled that message on telegram coz I didn't want nazar on my new friendship 🥹
7/11/24, 10:07 PM - Sayanth: I'm more dramatic
7/11/24, 10:07 PM - Sayanth: So no problem
7/11/24, 10:07 PM - Aishwarya: It's like i projected my view of a good character person on you and I thought you are not really like that 

But then you replied to that ,I understood that I had misunderstood you hehe
7/11/24, 10:08 PM - Aishwarya: Okay🤭hehe 
It's okay
7/11/24, 10:09 PM - Aishwarya: This one actually 
I got confused about it
7/11/24, 10:09 PM - Sayanth: Ok who's nazar
7/11/24, 10:09 PM - Aishwarya: But then you told this 
So my misunderstanding was cleared hehe
7/11/24, 10:10 PM - Aishwarya: I know it was joke 
But just in case you didn't know, it's kannu kittuka
That thing
7/11/24, 10:10 PM - Sayanth: Nah seriously I didn't know it was a word
7/11/24, 10:10 PM - Sayanth: Like till now
7/11/24, 10:11 PM - Aishwarya: Ohhh
7/11/24, 10:11 PM - Aishwarya: Okay

7/11/24, 10:12 PM - Sayanth: 🥹
7/11/24, 10:12 PM - Aishwarya: It's actually hindi word 
Nazar na lage
And it's used in hinglish language too ,like in bollywood movies rarelyy
7/11/24, 10:12 PM - Aishwarya: Oh 😂
Okay
7/11/24, 10:13 PM - Sayanth: Yeah idk hindi at all
7/11/24, 10:14 PM - Aishwarya: Alsoo I remembered something 
I couldn't tell my friend your age details 💀😭( coz I'm gonna get judged lol , even though it's a platonic friendship)
He asked where is your friend from

7/11/24, 10:39 PM - Aishwarya: So i wanted to talk to you everyday for like 5 to 10 minutes or so🥹

I think more than that time, I'm taking away from your time 
So 10 minutes seems like perfect balance
7/11/24, 10:40 PM - Aishwarya: My Delhi friend ,she and I had ran out of topics to talk about , so we stayed connected by sending reels🤭
7/11/24, 10:42 PM - Aishwarya: Whatever amount of time you like 

but 10 minutes you don't mind right?
Coz I wanted to talk to you everyday 

yk I don't have much human interactions coz I'm at home so no irl friends 
I only have online friends now 
And you are one of my favorite friend
7/11/24, 10:44 PM - Aishwarya: Yesterday I didn't have any topics to talk about, with you 

later I realised that ,thatswhy I trauma dumped a lot yesterday ,which was not even needed 
And then later I got worried if I burdened you ,when the venting was not even needed <This message was edited>
7/11/24, 10:47 PM - Aishwarya: Alsoo I want to be a good friend to you ,because I like you so much 🥹
7/11/24, 10:49 PM - Aishwarya: So feel free to message me if you are sad or want to talk about something ( apart from the checking in on you that I will do at 7)

7/16/24, 9:35 PM - Sayanth: There were a lot of issues
7/16/24, 9:35 PM - Aishwarya: Okay
7/16/24, 9:36 PM - Aishwarya: Your dad earns more than mom right ?
(Kind of)
7/16/24, 9:37 PM - Aishwarya: I think if both partners earn and work almost equal time etc ,they should split household work equally
7/16/24, 9:38 PM - Aishwarya: So I'm guessing your dad doesn't help with household work at home ?
( not judging coz in india it do tend to be like that for previous generation)
Just curious
7/16/24, 9:40 PM - Aishwarya: Btwww if it's something personal you donttt have to sayyyy
7/16/24, 9:48 PM - Aishwarya: But whatever the issues are ,parents shouldn't trouble their kid ,that's not a responsible behavior ,it's abuse kind of 

They should solve it within themselves
7/16/24, 10:11 PM - Sayanth: Yeah
7/16/24, 10:11 PM - Sayanth: Not that
7/16/24, 10:12 PM - Sayanth: It's more like she didn't get family time
7/16/24, 10:21 PM - Sayanth: Well he doesn't get leave much
7/16/24, 10:21 PM - Sayanth: So I won't blame him
7/16/24, 10:39 PM - Aishwarya: Oh okay

7/17/24, 8:34 PM - Aishwarya: So not the right emoji hehe
7/17/24, 8:35 PM - Aishwarya: Not disdain actually

You are one of the postive vibes in my life right now 🥹🥹🥹🥹🥹
7/17/24, 8:40 PM - Aishwarya: And idk if it's the halo effect thing 
You look positive 🥹
7/17/24, 8:40 PM - Aishwarya: Like the beauty of calm ocean 🥹 😂
7/17/24, 8:41 PM - Aishwarya: You are probably not calm half the time probably 🤔

Even though sometimes you get in not good moods
7/17/24, 8:42 PM - Aishwarya: This is how I think you are 🥹

7/17/24, 8:43 PM - Aishwarya: Ohhh 
But what about bpd moods ?🤔
7/17/24, 8:43 PM - Sayanth: Unless someone tries to actively annoy me
7/17/24, 8:43 PM - Sayanth: It's sad and happy
7/17/24, 8:43 PM - Aishwarya: Ohh okay 

That everyone is like that
7/17/24, 8:43 PM - Sayanth: I don't get angry cuz of bpd
7/17/24, 8:43 PM - Sayanth: + I'll always keep it inside me
7/17/24, 8:44 PM - Aishwarya: Ohh that's good 

I thought you had an angry bpd side even though you look like paavam and cute
7/17/24, 8:44 PM - Aishwarya: Ohh okay 
That's good
7/17/24, 8:45 PM - Sayanth: i dont get angry unless u know its really a bad situation like if the other person is trying to provoke me by touching or pushing me physically
7/17/24, 8:46 PM - Aishwarya: Oh okay
7/17/24, 8:46 PM - Aishwarya: Got it now
7/17/24, 8:47 PM - Aishwarya: So the sad is not accompanied by angry 

That's really good 

I know that it's not always correlated and it depends on the person
7/17/24, 8:49 PM - Sayanth: yup well i dont get angry when im sad. but i get sad when im angry tho
7/17/24, 8:49 PM - Aishwarya: Though ,for many guys it's correlated I think 

Especially the alpha wannabes💀

Like for them only one negative emotions which is they show- anger 
And they don't think that's being emotional
7/17/24, 8:49 PM - Sayanth: ikkk
7/17/24, 8:49 PM - Aishwarya: Ohh 🥹🥹🥹
7/17/24, 8:49 PM - Aishwarya: Ohh okayy
7/17/24, 8:51 PM - Aishwarya: Omg

7/17/24, 8:51 PM - Aishwarya: Alsoo
7/17/24, 8:52 PM - Aishwarya: How are your guy friends?
Are they angry type ?
7/17/24, 8:53 PM - Aishwarya: Idk much about guys personally 
Other than family members
7/17/24, 8:55 PM - Aishwarya: I mean I know ,but not much in detail coz I never had guy friends irl
7/17/24, 8:55 PM - Aishwarya: Some of my extroverted girl friends had guy friends
7/17/24, 8:56 PM - Aishwarya: For me, I don't get angry unless some actual valid reason
So I'm proud of that
7/17/24, 8:57 PM - Sayanth: nope
7/17/24, 8:57 PM - Sayanth: i cant get along with those kinda ppl
7/17/24, 8:57 PM - Sayanth: at all
7/17/24, 8:58 PM - Sayanth: good goood
7/17/24, 8:58 PM - Aishwarya: And I'm proud that I don't secretly not like my friends 
If i grow to dislike them( coz of something they did or whatever the reason) ,I just keep distance or cut off
7/17/24, 8:58 PM - Aishwarya: Okay
7/17/24, 8:58 PM - Sayanth: Same
7/17/24, 8:58 PM - Aishwarya: Yaa
7/17/24, 8:58 PM - Aishwarya: Ya ,that's good
7/17/24, 9:01 PM - Aishwarya: My best friend in college, she disrespected her another friend 

And then two years later ,she posted some whatsapp status about some letter exchange they had when they first met 💀😭
7/17/24, 9:01 PM - Sayanth: Yeah well kinda opposite in my experience
7/17/24, 9:01 PM - Sayanth: So there was this girl in class
7/17/24, 9:01 PM - Sayanth: 9th grade
7/17/24, 9:02 PM - Sayanth: I kinda had a soft corner for her
7/17/24, 9:02 PM - Sayanth: Cuz her mom died of cancer
7/17/24, 9:02 PM - Sayanth: And she was like really interested in me as a friend
7/17/24, 9:02 PM - Aishwarya: My best friend in college , she has helped with some stuff ( I have helped her too )
But she was there for me when I needed it the most 
But there was not a situation where she needed me much ,but I have always tried to return favors
7/17/24, 9:02 PM - Aishwarya: In the sense ,she was a good person
7/17/24, 9:03 PM - Sayanth: She's all sweet irl with other girls
7/17/24, 9:03 PM - Aishwarya: Oh🥺
7/17/24, 9:03 PM - Aishwarya: Okay ,that's good 🥺🥹
7/17/24, 9:03 PM - Aishwarya: Okay
7/17/24, 9:03 PM - Aishwarya: Okay
7/17/24, 9:03 PM - Sayanth: But online she used bitch about other girls
7/17/24, 9:04 PM - Sayanth: It was mostly about our class leader
7/17/24, 9:04 PM - Sayanth: And she was actually generally nice ,studious kinda girl
7/17/24, 9:04 PM - Aishwarya: But idk why she did that though ( with that other friend )

I feel like for some extroverts they have time to care enough about their actions beyond a point 🤔

Like not thinking deep lol
7/17/24, 9:04 PM - Aishwarya: Hm💀
7/17/24, 9:05 PM - Aishwarya: Oh
7/17/24, 9:06 PM - Aishwarya: I hope she had some reason to lowkey talk ,in not so respectful way, about that friend 🥺
( like the other friend doing the same to her first, for example)
7/17/24, 9:06 PM - Aishwarya: Okay
7/17/24, 9:07 PM - Aishwarya: Oh I mean , she didn't disrespect that friend in public 
She did in secret ( while talking about her to me )
7/17/24, 9:09 PM - Aishwarya: Not a major thing though 

But not that good of a thing to say either 
I expected more from her 🥺

7/19/24, 7:21 PM - Sayanth: Ok
7/19/24, 7:21 PM - Sayanth: Understandable
7/19/24, 7:21 PM - Aishwarya: Especially the two girls ,they have said about how much they hate it

Plus some college observations
7/19/24, 7:27 PM - Aishwarya: There was a muslim guy who used to do hookups ,drugs etc 
He was slut shaming a girl who didn't wear hijab and because she had a boyfriend
7/19/24, 7:28 PM - Aishwarya: From my observations muslim men tend to be extra misogynistic
7/19/24, 7:29 PM - Sayanth: Yes
7/19/24, 7:30 PM - Sayanth: Go on
7/19/24, 7:30 PM - Aishwarya: I had a met a Pakistani guy online 
He seemed like a good person at first 
Plus he was kinda cute 
My Delhi friend had previously told me avoid fully all muslim men especially from pakistan( coz they tend to be misogynistic from what they a taught and grown up around)
There was some red flags at first but since he was cute ,I didn't see him as negative 
But then later I understood that this person is a major red flag and so annoying
7/19/24, 7:32 PM - Aishwarya: Like he was understanding at first ,about my traumas 
So that also a reason why thought that he must be kind of good 
And since I didn't have friends apart from my delhi friend during that time ,thats also a reason
7/19/24, 7:32 PM - Aishwarya: https://www.reddit.com/r/KindVoice/s/hz8Nu7ko4R
7/19/24, 7:32 PM - Sayanth: Ok
7/19/24, 7:33 PM - Aishwarya: Actually I met him from here 
He had posted here
7/19/24, 7:33 PM - Sayanth: Ok got it
7/19/24, 7:34 PM - Aishwarya: Like this subreddit is supposedly kind people 

But I have met two girls from here 
They were good
But they were kind of buzy 
And they weren't really interested to be mutual support friends I think 
They were from Europe, so even the time difference was manageable
7/19/24, 7:35 PM - Sayanth: Oh
7/19/24, 7:35 PM - Aishwarya: But like the four men I met here ,three of them turnt out to be red flags 
The first two guys I understood it from the first day
7/19/24, 7:37 PM - Aishwarya: The second guy , i thought of him as very kind 
For a few months actually 
I have messaged him total 7 days or less though, over many months
7/19/24, 7:37 PM - Aishwarya: Twice he listened to me
7/19/24, 7:38 PM - Aishwarya: And like the second time ,i understood that he is a red flag 
But I think I don't want to say the reason
7/19/24, 7:39 PM - Sayanth: Ok
7/19/24, 7:39 PM - Sayanth: If u don't want to
7/19/24, 7:39 PM - Sayanth: It's fine
7/19/24, 7:39 PM - Sayanth: But I'm curious
7/19/24, 7:39 PM - Sayanth: And I won't judge u for that
7/19/24, 7:39 PM - Sayanth: If u do
7/19/24, 7:39 PM - Aishwarya: And I told about a guy friend right ,I used to talk to him everyday 
He is from west bengal
After many months I understood that he is not the person I thought he was
7/19/24, 7:40 PM - Aishwarya: Okay
7/19/24, 7:40 PM - Aishwarya: Okay
7/19/24, 7:40 PM - Sayanth: Ok and
7/19/24, 7:40 PM - Sayanth: Why
7/19/24, 7:41 PM - Aishwarya: He has told that guys from north east tend to be less misogynistic 
I kind of believe that
7/19/24, 7:43 PM - Aishwarya: The caste thing 

Plus there was some other minor things too ,but that is more alright coz of the context ,but still idk
Like he commented on some reddit video fat shaming some girl 
But the girl did something wrong though 
But why to commend on body
7/19/24, 7:44 PM - Sayanth: Yeah understandable
7/19/24, 7:45 PM - Aishwarya: And during the period when me and him were not friends anymore ,he posted a whatsapp story 
It was a dark skin man and fair woman 
He knows that is the most triggering thing for me ( but due to some reason I was not mad at him though, but I did judge him as someone who don't care about my mental health)
7/19/24, 7:47 PM - Aishwarya: The whatsapp story was about their wholesome marriage 
The man returning from work and coming home to his sweet loving wife 
And the caption was ' zinda rahne ka kaaran'

Which means ,reason to live, (for men )
7/19/24, 7:48 PM - Sayanth: Oh
7/19/24, 7:48 PM - Aishwarya: But like I'm not mad at him though 
I have this thing that no matter what fair guys do ,I don't really care ( in the sense I'm not mad or offended etc )
Idk if that makes sense
7/19/24, 7:49 PM - Aishwarya: But I don't see him as a friend who cares about the mental health of the people who are his friends 
Atleast not me
7/19/24, 7:51 PM - Aishwarya: Oh ,it's coz the dark skin men , if they are not for dark skin women ,they who lol 

Also I have been fed such ideas growing up ,like marriage and kids as purpose 
So I feel like I have been bamboozled 
Such reasons
7/19/24, 7:52 PM - Aishwarya: For example, after school I was not allowed to go outside kerala for studies ,at first ,coz it might effect my chances in marriage
7/19/24, 7:55 PM - Aishwarya: Like dark guys
(Getting married to fair guy ,that's like not even on the list , so i never even thought of it btw )
And later I got to know that dark guys also like fair girls too 
I mean I already kind of knew it ,but not the extend of it
7/19/24, 7:55 PM - Sayanth: Ok go on
7/19/24, 7:57 PM - Aishwarya: Which is okay 
They can have their preferences 

But like my college option etc being effected by this marriage thingy ,that was not fair to me;  because I'm not the girl who the guys want ( dark guys ,not even considering the fair guys )
7/19/24, 7:58 PM - Aishwarya: I have cousin guy ,he is very dark 
And he couldn't do a professional course even 
So he did bcom
Anyways even he got a fair kind of cute girlfriend
7/19/24, 7:59 PM - Sayanth: U text ok . I'll brb in 20 mins
7/19/24, 7:59 PM - Aishwarya: But they couldn't marry coz his mom didn't approve coz of caste differences
7/19/24, 7:59 PM - Aishwarya: Okay
7/19/24, 8:01 PM - Aishwarya: So he got alliance of a dark girl 
She had everything except not fair
Actually she was some shades darker than me 
I think my shade is more acceptable in kerala , but not beautiful ofcourse 

But like he is more darker than her though
7/19/24, 8:03 PM - Aishwarya: Alsoo , dark skin guys face rejections too though 
But I have noticed that if they overall look okay , it doesn't really effect their serious relationship options
Especially my skin tone and bit less guys
7/19/24, 8:04 PM - Aishwarya: But this guy was very dark though 
Such guys tend to face discrimination 
Even my best friend in college ,her bf was very dark 
Those guys face discrimination 
But still some of them get fair cute girls ,coz girls are not as shallow
7/19/24, 8:07 PM - Aishwarya: And there are some girls who say they like dusky guys more than fair guys 
I know three girls like that ,two of those girls are very fair 
And because of that those guys tend to go for fair girls and then settle for my skin tone girls coz they didn't get lucky to get them
7/19/24, 8:08 PM - Aishwarya: And I know that just because a girl is fair ,doesn't automatically make her cute 
But its is a major advantage for girls
7/19/24, 8:09 PM - Aishwarya: Like my second crush in college; his girlfriend she is fair but her face is not girly looking 
But he liked her much much more than me
7/19/24, 8:11 PM - Aishwarya: My first crush in college, the girl he liked, I have better face and body than her 
She in fact has bit of a hunchback even
7/19/24, 8:11 PM - Aishwarya: But she was fair
7/19/24, 8:11 PM - Aishwarya: Like I have clearly better face and body than her 
But whatever
7/19/24, 8:12 PM - Aishwarya: Like my face is not perfect ofcourse
But kind of nice
7/19/24, 8:13 PM - Aishwarya: And two guys who were my skin tone ,they got offended when some other guy shipped them with me I think 
Like it was visible
7/19/24, 8:14 PM - Aishwarya: Both their girlfriends were fair and cute
7/19/24, 8:14 PM - Aishwarya: Once I was venting about something to one of that guy ,and he seemed to be annoyed 
And I went home and cried lol
7/19/24, 8:15 PM - Aishwarya: But later he treated his ex girlfriend ( who was fair and kind of cute) horribly during the breakup, to get with his new girlfriend
7/19/24, 8:16 PM - Aishwarya: Idk why ,but I felt bit relieved 
Coz I understood that beautiful girls have their share of problems too ,especially from guys
7/19/24, 8:17 PM - Aishwarya: Like I thought I was not worthy of ,some time even 🥲
7/19/24, 8:17 PM - Aishwarya: Anywayssssss
7/19/24, 8:17 PM - Aishwarya: Why I told all this is because
7/19/24, 8:18 PM - Aishwarya: I just wanted to explain from where my views came from
7/19/24, 8:23 PM - Aishwarya: Like my childfree views ( and some other views )
And I believe not everyone should have kids
7/19/24, 9:50 PM - Aishwarya: Hey
7/19/24, 9:50 PM - Aishwarya: Did you get annoyed ?🤔
7/19/24, 9:50 PM - Aishwarya: Why no reply
7/19/24, 9:54 PM - Aishwarya: You no longer want to be friends with me?🤔
7/19/24, 9:54 PM - Aishwarya: Or just buzy ?

7/19/24, 10:25 PM - Aishwarya: Okay
7/19/24, 10:28 PM - Sayanth: Well one thing I wanna tell you is you are not inferior to anyone don't ever think like that. You are pretty pretty. And I'm sure u can get anyone be it fair skin or dark toned guys
7/19/24, 10:28 PM - Aishwarya: Okay 🥹
Thanks
7/19/24, 10:30 PM - Sayanth: Yeah kinda same here my parents weren't exactly supportive either they had said something similar to me as well
7/19/24, 10:30 PM - Sayanth: Well the restricting college thing was not at all fair
7/19/24, 10:31 PM - Aishwarya: Ohh sorry you had to face that 

But guy's parents usually don't care about it
7/19/24, 10:31 PM - Aishwarya: Yaa😕
7/19/24, 10:31 PM - Sayanth: But dude u are honestly really pretty idk why u think like that but why would u think guys wouldn't be into u
7/19/24, 10:32 PM - Aishwarya: Okay 🥹
7/19/24, 10:32 PM - Sayanth: Yeah true but my parents are bit over protective of me
7/19/24, 10:32 PM - Sayanth: Oh damn that's really sad
7/19/24, 10:33 PM - Sayanth: Dude for the 100th time u are pretty, beautiful, aesthetically pleasing
7/19/24, 10:33 PM - Aishwarya: Also I just wanted to say my view points 
Like I wanted my friend to understand the reasons why I think the way I think 🙂

I hope you accept that about me 🥺
7/19/24, 10:33 PM - Sayanth: Yeah that's true.
7/19/24, 10:33 PM - Sayanth: I get it
7/19/24, 10:33 PM - Aishwarya: Oh okay
7/19/24, 10:34 PM - Aishwarya: Ya
7/19/24, 10:34 PM - Sayanth: But see you are kinda conditioned to think u are not pretty
7/19/24, 10:34 PM - Aishwarya: Okay 🥹🥹🥹
7/19/24, 10:34 PM - Sayanth: Which is obviously not true
7/19/24, 10:34 PM - Aishwarya: Okay ,thanks 🥺🥹🥹
7/19/24, 10:34 PM - Aishwarya: Ya
7/19/24, 10:34 PM - Aishwarya: Okay🥹
7/19/24, 10:34 PM - Sayanth: Also I don't see any problem with you
7/19/24, 10:35 PM - Sayanth: Other than ur low confidence about skin tone
7/19/24, 10:35 PM - Aishwarya: Okay 🥹
Thank you 🥹
7/19/24, 10:35 PM - Aishwarya: Okay 🥹
7/19/24, 10:36 PM - Sayanth: Yeah u are right on most cases like some people discriminate against darker shades and there are medias that portrays darker skin tone as ugly
7/19/24, 10:36 PM - Sayanth: But guess what
7/19/24, 10:36 PM - Aishwarya: Yaaa
7/19/24, 10:36 PM - Sayanth: Lord Krishna was dark skinned
7/19/24, 10:36 PM - Sayanth: He was pretty
7/19/24, 10:36 PM - Aishwarya: Yaa but he was a guy
7/19/24, 10:36 PM - Aishwarya: Yaa
7/19/24, 10:37 PM - Sayanth: Ok well Cleopatra
7/19/24, 10:37 PM - Sayanth: She wasn't exactly white
7/19/24, 10:38 PM - Aishwarya: Like in real world dark skin guys don't face that much discrimination 
Ofcourse fair skin is an advantage for guys too
Even dark skin black guys have many takers 
Pluss guys worth is not mostly valued just based on looks
7/19/24, 10:38 PM - Sayanth: Or halle berry
7/19/24, 10:39 PM - Aishwarya: Yaa I think she was tan 
Tan is different though 

I think in non asian countries  , many guys prefer tan over pale skin tone 
Or not much of a difference
7/19/24, 10:39 PM - Sayanth: Ok we are not talking about if they are valued or not but purely in the sense beauty
7/19/24, 10:39 PM - Sayanth: She was brown
7/19/24, 10:39 PM - Sayanth: Kinda like us
7/19/24, 10:39 PM - Sayanth: She's half Greek and half Egyptian
7/19/24, 10:40 PM - Aishwarya: Yaa she is light brown
So less than tan 
But still light skin enough 

And I was talking not just about me 
Like the struggles of an actual dark skin girl is much more than my skin tone girls 
There is levels
7/19/24, 10:40 PM - Sayanth: The thing is u should really try to accept u are pretty
7/19/24, 10:40 PM - Sayanth: Noo she's black
7/19/24, 10:40 PM - Sayanth: W8
7/19/24, 10:41 PM - Aishwarya: Yaa I know that I don't look bad 
And that skin is just one of the factors of beauty 

Plus I like tan and pale skin equally 
I don't think the lighter is better 

But I do think lighter skin tone look better than much dark skin tone ,coz light skin adds contrast to the face
7/19/24, 10:42 PM - Sayanth: Ok I understand but
7/19/24, 10:42 PM - Sayanth: Well that's your preference
7/19/24, 10:42 PM - Sayanth: Right
7/19/24, 10:42 PM - Aishwarya: Yaa her race is black 

But skin tone is light brown 
Let me check again 

Like zendaya is mixed black, but she is proper light skin
7/19/24, 10:42 PM - Aishwarya: Ya
7/19/24, 10:44 PM - Sayanth: Yeah
7/19/24, 10:45 PM - Sayanth: Dude it's all about lighting I guess
7/19/24, 10:45 PM - Sayanth: U are not average or anything
7/19/24, 10:45 PM - Sayanth: U look totally pretty
7/19/24, 10:46 PM - Aishwarya: I don't have any skin tone preferences in guys per say in terms of sexual and romantic attraction 

But I usually don't like very dark guys 
But it depends ,some I like some I don't like 

But in terms of aesthetic I find light skin guys to be more pretty 
But I'm not necessarily attracted just based on looks 

Also what I meant is dark skin girls face lot of struggle 
So that is were my view points come from 
( not about my personal struggles, coz I have kind of accepted that life is not fair and life is struggle ; some people struggle more )
7/19/24, 10:47 PM - Sayanth: Well may be its cuz they weren't into you.  Not because they were repulsed or anything I mean I wouldn't wanna be shipped with someone I'm not into
7/19/24, 10:47 PM - Aishwarya: Yaa light skin people are visible in no light too 💀
Which is good
7/19/24, 10:48 PM - Sayanth: I see
7/19/24, 10:49 PM - Sayanth: Well yeah everyone has their own problems
7/19/24, 10:49 PM - Sayanth: That's what I'm saying
7/19/24, 10:49 PM - Aishwarya: Yaa 
Not repulsed ,that I know 
Plus they were always nice to me 
But if I was fair and cute,then they would have enjoyed the shipping 

It is what it is though
7/19/24, 10:49 PM - Aishwarya: Yaa
7/19/24, 10:50 PM - Sayanth: Stop thinking about how other people see u ok
7/19/24, 10:50 PM - Sayanth: I mean I get it
7/19/24, 10:50 PM - Sayanth: But it's gonna ruin ur mind
7/19/24, 10:51 PM - Aishwarya: But like some things are guaranteed suffering 

Like homeless people having kids for example 

Similarly for dark people 
But there are levels 
My level of dark, the struggle was not being guys 'type'
Even more dark skin tone people will be bullied ( even in kerala, coz they are darker than the average person )
7/19/24, 10:51 PM - Aishwarya: Ya
7/19/24, 10:51 PM - Aishwarya: Okay🥹
7/19/24, 10:52 PM - Aishwarya: Ya that I know 
So it's not something that's actively on my mind 

Coz I have accepted it 
So I focus on things I can work on ,in looks also 
And not focus on uncontrollable factors
7/19/24, 10:54 PM - Sayanth: Nah dude that's something u are wrong about.  See ok may be are right but from my pov I wouldn't wanna be shipped with someone I'm not into it's kinda idk I hate it. I wouldn't enjoy being shipped with someone else who I'm not into
7/19/24, 10:54 PM - Sayanth: Yeah that's true
7/19/24, 10:56 PM - Aishwarya: But I do feel some type of way about dark skin people having kids 🙂

Is what I was saying 

There was a white guy who said he disagree with it 
But he agree that people who actually don't like each other should not have kids 

So that includes dark guys who don't like dark girls but have kids with them, because they couldn't get fair girl 


Same for girls who hate their skin tone because it's dark ,but goes on to have kids ( plus dark girls who don't like dark guys, but idk the percentage of them though )
7/19/24, 10:56 PM - Sayanth: I mean u look pretty I'm not lying nor I'm trying to comfort u but u are actually pretty yeah u have a darker skin tone but so what . Some people might find it not attractive well their loss they Can't perceive that beauty that's all . See you are pretty you don't have to compromise ok
7/19/24, 10:57 PM - Aishwarya: Ya probably it's like that for you 
But guys usually are not like that 🙂
Conventionally pretty girls= they are into them ( or atleast they don't mind being shipped )
7/19/24, 10:57 PM - Sayanth: Perhaps
7/19/24, 10:57 PM - Aishwarya: Yaaaa
7/19/24, 10:57 PM - Sayanth: But why think about them
7/19/24, 10:59 PM - Sayanth: I mean if they have some kinda genetical defect it's better not to pass down it
7/19/24, 11:00 PM - Sayanth: But dark skin isn't a defect nor it's a bad thing
7/19/24, 11:00 PM - Sayanth: Nor it's inferior or ugly
7/19/24, 11:00 PM - Aishwarya: Okay🥹
Thanks 
Plus don't you think I will be prettier with lighter skin tone 
Anyways most guys will feel so 

I have kind of nice face and body ,so I can be good enough to many guys that I know 

What I meant is skin colour is more genetic 
Face ,body not that much 

So like dark people having kids is a big gamble ,in the sense the child is guaranteed to experience lot of suffering
7/19/24, 11:01 PM - Sayanth: Nah nah skin color is less genetic u can kinda change it but body and face not much like the bone structure and things
7/19/24, 11:02 PM - Sayanth: Yeah u can do plastic surgery or go to gym and all
7/19/24, 11:02 PM - Aishwarya: I don't really think about them 

Coz I have accepted some things 

But it influences the quality of life is what I was trying to say 
So that is where my views come from ( related to not everyone should have kids🙂)
7/19/24, 11:02 PM - Sayanth: But bone structure not much
7/19/24, 11:02 PM - Sayanth: Leave all this
7/19/24, 11:02 PM - Sayanth: You are pretty
7/19/24, 11:02 PM - Aishwarya: Yaaa 

That also 
That's primary things
7/19/24, 11:02 PM - Sayanth: Ok
7/19/24, 11:02 PM - Sayanth: Just accept it
7/19/24, 11:03 PM - Sayanth: And enjoy the music
7/19/24, 11:03 PM - Sayanth: The moment
7/19/24, 11:03 PM - Sayanth: I'm here for you ok
7/19/24, 11:07 PM - Aishwarya: Face I have seen ,not so good face parents having kids with kinda nice features and vice versa 

Plus body yes genetics plays a role, but mostly in height 
But height for girls doesn't matter at all kind of 
For guys yes it matters
But most girls usually just prefer guys their height or bit taller 
Even the girls who prefer much taller guys ,they are not that vocal about( unlike guys who say their preferences in unnecessary situations also ,traumatize girls and make them feel non worthy)

And body shape thing , has bit of genetics ,even though it's more random 
But for girls all body types are accepted unless she is too fat ( but fat can be controlled)
7/19/24, 11:07 PM - Aishwarya: Okay
7/19/24, 11:07 PM - Aishwarya: Okay 🥹
7/19/24, 11:07 PM - Aishwarya: Okay 
Yaa
7/19/24, 11:07 PM - Aishwarya: Okay
7/19/24, 11:07 PM - Aishwarya: Yaa
7/19/24, 11:08 PM - Sayanth: See you don't have to worry about any of these
7/19/24, 11:08 PM - Sayanth: Also I've a question
7/19/24, 11:08 PM - Sayanth: Would you change your mind about having kids if u find someone with fair skin or move to another country?
7/19/24, 11:09 PM - Aishwarya: Okay 🥹

But do you feel some type of way about my views?
Be honest 

I know that friends don't have to have same views 

But I think it good if they are able to see different perspective
7/19/24, 11:10 PM - Sayanth: Well what I think is you are thinking too much about how others see you and about skin tone
7/19/24, 11:10 PM - Aishwarya: Or atleast understand that ,oh this person has gone through all this ,so I understand why they think like this , even though I don't personally agree
7/19/24, 11:11 PM - Aishwarya: In regards to my views on not everyone should have kids
7/19/24, 11:11 PM - Sayanth: Which makes u feel less confident
7/19/24, 11:11 PM - Sayanth: Yeah I understand that
7/19/24, 11:12 PM - Aishwarya: No
At first I wanted to have kids with a white guy 

But then coz of health changes and body changes after pregnancy ,fully no
7/19/24, 11:12 PM - Aishwarya: Ya🙂
7/19/24, 11:13 PM - Aishwarya: Okay ,that is what I was asking 🥹

I'm glad you understand my views 😭🥹
7/19/24, 11:14 PM - Sayanth: But from my pov it's not healthy for you it's limiting you from things
7/19/24, 11:16 PM - Aishwarya: How?🤔

Like my confidence level is related to not being guy's type 

Not coz of my views 
In fact, my views have made me feel better that it's not my fault that my skin colour is dark ,it's my parents 💀😂
My dads especially 
My dad is my skin tone and my mom is medium fair
7/19/24, 11:18 PM - Aishwarya: My views have made my mental health better 
Coz whenever i see parents who are skin colour obsessed plus dark have kids, I feel better that I'm not like that, for example 

I take pride in not passing on this suffering
7/19/24, 11:20 PM - Sayanth: It's no one's fault
7/19/24, 11:20 PM - Sayanth: I mean yeah u got genes from your parents
7/19/24, 11:20 PM - Sayanth: But it's not an issue
7/19/24, 11:21 PM - Sayanth: Well I'd choose u over my crush . If I were looking for just physical beauty
7/19/24, 11:22 PM - Aishwarya: Yaa so if anything it's their fault right 

My dad has said that he had another more fair and cuter girl who wanted to marry him ( coz he had nice enough job I think )
But he chose mom 

But actually he chose mom because her parents gave more dowry 
Plus she was fair too ,even though medium fair 
Not fair fair
7/19/24, 11:22 PM - Sayanth: You are restricting yourself thinking guys wouldn't be into u
7/19/24, 11:23 PM - Aishwarya: Which crush 

But you haven't seen her right ?
7/19/24, 11:23 PM - Sayanth: I did
7/19/24, 11:24 PM - Sayanth: I had told u
7/19/24, 11:24 PM - Sayanth: She gave me her insta
7/19/24, 11:24 PM - Aishwarya: Oh okay
7/19/24, 11:24 PM - Aishwarya: I don't really believe you 😂
7/19/24, 11:24 PM - Sayanth: Not give but she followed me from her real id
7/19/24, 11:24 PM - Aishwarya: Okay
7/19/24, 11:24 PM - Aishwarya: But you are so sweet though 🥹
That is appreciated
7/19/24, 11:24 PM - Sayanth: Well told u it's restricting
7/19/24, 11:25 PM - Sayanth: That's what I meant
7/19/24, 11:25 PM - Sayanth: I'm kinda conditioned to believe I'm unlovable
7/19/24, 11:25 PM - Aishwarya: These kind of guys are not common
7/19/24, 11:25 PM - Aishwarya: Oh 😕
7/19/24, 11:25 PM - Sayanth: But I stepped thinking about this and craving and all
7/19/24, 11:26 PM - Aishwarya: That's good
7/19/24, 11:26 PM - Sayanth: After she rejected me I kinda confirmed it that I'm
7/19/24, 11:26 PM - Aishwarya: Like this itself is a good thing about you ,yk
7/19/24, 11:26 PM - Sayanth: Yeah may be
7/19/24, 11:26 PM - Aishwarya: Ya I understand that feeling
7/19/24, 11:27 PM - Sayanth: See that's what I'm saying even if someone tells me they love I wouldn't believe them
7/19/24, 11:27 PM - Sayanth: I can't
7/19/24, 11:28 PM - Aishwarya: I understand
7/19/24, 11:28 PM - Aishwarya: Especially in guys who are not narcissistic its like that 😭
7/19/24, 11:29 PM - Aishwarya: Like they feel unlovable 
Meanwhile narcissistic guys they think so highly of themselves
7/19/24, 11:30 PM - Aishwarya: I got remembered of my best friends ex boyfriend 💀
His mom has given him so much love ,care and validation that he internalized it too much
7/19/24, 11:31 PM - Sayanth: Oh that's sad
7/19/24, 11:32 PM - Aishwarya: In terms of looks ,I already told 
Not saying in detail again coz I feel cringe 💀
But yea you are cute

But like your character its so precious 😭🥹it's not common
7/19/24, 11:34 PM - Aishwarya: Imo many girls character is kind of okay to good 
But most of them are not bad
7/19/24, 11:34 PM - Aishwarya: But guys ,good guys definitely exist 
But still
7/19/24, 11:35 PM - Aishwarya: Like this is a common opinion ofcourse
7/19/24, 11:36 PM - Sayanth: Well it doesn't matter now. Imma try to not get attached to anyone from now on and detach from everyone.
7/19/24, 11:36 PM - Aishwarya: Yaa 
That's good
7/19/24, 11:37 PM - Aishwarya: I'm also like that 
I don't really get attached these days, coz i know that it's just chemical reactions in my brain 💀

But I have some crushes here and there coz otherwise life is boring
7/19/24, 11:38 PM - Aishwarya: And especially in today's world , I would say you should really guard your heart even though you are a guy 

Good guys getting hurt by girls is so undeserved:(
7/19/24, 11:40 PM - Aishwarya: Like you should date ,but have a life outside of it 
And have other priorities in life 

And when reach an age when you want to settle down with a girl ,still you should be prepared a heartbreak 
I think for that , only way is to practice some level of detachment 

And mostttt importantly not to attach one's worth to the partners they are dating
7/19/24, 11:42 PM - Aishwarya: Coz these days even if someone find a partner they like , these days it's more easily to cheat 

So should always gaurd the heart
7/20/24, 7:01 PM - Aishwarya: Hey
7/20/24, 7:01 PM - Aishwarya: How are you today ?
7/20/24, 10:04 PM - Aishwarya: Hey

7/20/24, 10:21 PM - Sayanth: I wasn't in good state
7/20/24, 10:21 PM - Sayanth: Headache
7/20/24, 10:22 PM - Aishwarya: Oh

7/20/24, 10:22 PM - Aishwarya: No problem
7/20/24, 10:22 PM - Aishwarya: May you feel better soon🥺🥹
7/20/24, 10:22 PM - Sayanth: Yeah

7/20/24, 10:30 PM - Aishwarya: Okay
7/20/24, 10:30 PM - Aishwarya: I'm finee
7/20/24, 10:30 PM - Sayanth: Hm
7/20/24, 10:30 PM - Aishwarya: Okay
7/20/24, 10:31 PM - Sayanth: U sure u are ok?
7/20/24, 10:31 PM - Aishwarya: Yaa
7/20/24, 10:31 PM - Aishwarya: Rn I was thinking if you will be replying me late most of the days because you are feeling down
7/20/24, 10:32 PM - Aishwarya: I know you have to take time for yourself and to rest
7/20/24, 10:33 PM - Aishwarya: I dont know if I can ask it like that 
But around how many days a month you will be in sad moods ?
7/20/24, 10:33 PM - Sayanth: idk
7/20/24, 10:33 PM - Sayanth: its totally random
7/20/24, 10:33 PM - Aishwarya: Okay
7/20/24, 10:34 PM - Sayanth: i had some work too
7/20/24, 10:34 PM - Aishwarya: What do you do when you are in sad moods ?
7/20/24, 10:34 PM - Aishwarya: Sleep ?
7/20/24, 10:34 PM - Sayanth: nothing
7/20/24, 10:34 PM - Aishwarya: Oh okay
7/20/24, 10:34 PM - Aishwarya: Oh
7/20/24, 10:34 PM - Sayanth: ill text u at 11 ?
7/20/24, 10:35 PM - Aishwarya: Yaaa
7/20/24, 10:35 PM - Aishwarya: But no pressure 
You take your time to recharge 🙂
7/20/24, 10:36 PM - Aishwarya: I just want to speak to you everyday for some time 
Small amount of time is also perfectly okay
7/20/24, 10:36 PM - Aishwarya: Because I don't have any other friends 😭
I mean I do have 
But you are the more good person
7/20/24, 10:38 PM - Aishwarya: Also no need to speak everyday even 
But I want to remain friends 
Speaking everyday will help with that I think
7/20/24, 10:41 PM - Aishwarya: Like something happened yesterday with my pune friend and I don't think of her the same anymore 
I want to be surrounded by good people 😭
Where are they
7/20/24, 10:42 PM - Aishwarya: I have somethings to say 
Will message when you are free again
7/20/24, 10:55 PM - Sayanth: Tell me now
7/20/24, 10:55 PM - Sayanth: I can listen
7/20/24, 10:55 PM - Sayanth: I just don't have the energy to text like other days
7/20/24, 10:57 PM - Aishwarya: Okay
7/20/24, 10:57 PM - Aishwarya: It is not important actually 
I can tell about it another day 

Mainly I meant that, I like that you are so good 🥹
7/20/24, 10:58 PM - Aishwarya: And I feel happy that I have your friendship 🥹
7/20/24, 11:03 PM - Aishwarya: And when we are surrounded by good people ,we ourselves become more good 🥹
7/20/24, 11:04 PM - Aishwarya: Some people are just unnecessary haters 😭
7/20/24, 11:04 PM - Aishwarya: Of other people
7/20/24, 11:05 PM - Sayanth: Yeah I get that
7/20/24, 11:06 PM - Sayanth: I'm just totally out of energy today that's all
7/20/24, 11:06 PM - Sayanth: Nah tell me
7/20/24, 11:06 PM - Aishwarya: That's okay
7/20/24, 11:06 PM - Sayanth: I wanna know
7/20/24, 11:06 PM - Aishwarya: Ohh but will be draining to your energy ?
Since you are already not energetic today
7/20/24, 11:07 PM - Sayanth: No it's ok
7/20/24, 11:07 PM - Aishwarya: I will feel bad if I contribute to that 😭 <This message was edited>
7/20/24, 11:07 PM - Aishwarya: Okay then
7/20/24, 11:07 PM - Sayanth: Tell meeee
7/20/24, 11:07 PM - Aishwarya: Okayy
7/20/24, 11:07 PM - Aishwarya: Alsooo
Pleasee don't judge me okay🥺
7/20/24, 11:07 PM - Sayanth: I'll go to sleep soon but tell me before that
7/20/24, 11:08 PM - Sayanth: Yeah I won't
7/20/24, 11:08 PM - Aishwarya: Okay
7/20/24, 11:08 PM - Aishwarya: Okay
7/20/24, 11:08 PM - Aishwarya: So like the thing I told about muslim women and muslim people yesterday
7/20/24, 11:09 PM - Aishwarya: She had told something yesterday, saying that muslim women are stupid coz how can they follow islam
7/20/24, 11:10 PM - Aishwarya: There is a quote
7/20/24, 11:10 PM - Aishwarya: Women liking islam is like chicken liking kfc
7/20/24, 11:10 PM - Sayanth: Ok
7/20/24, 11:10 PM - Aishwarya: Ya
7/20/24, 11:10 PM - Aishwarya: So like
7/20/24, 11:11 PM - Aishwarya: She was saying about that
7/20/24, 11:11 PM - Aishwarya: We have discussed the islam topic long ago ,before this
7/20/24, 11:11 PM - Aishwarya: So she was saying that , many of the muslim are fully aware 
So they are not victims
7/20/24, 11:12 PM - Aishwarya: I mean they are not victims if some horrors of Islam happened to them 
Coz they chose it themselves
7/20/24, 11:13 PM - Sayanth: Ok
7/20/24, 11:13 PM - Aishwarya: This not related to the palestine issue btw 
I actually haven't looked into it 
So idk who side is more correct or wrong
7/20/24, 11:13 PM - Aishwarya: This is related to normal Muslim people, in india for example
7/20/24, 11:14 PM - Sayanth: Okk
7/20/24, 11:14 PM - Aishwarya: I told about that guy from my college right 
He has a lot of misogyny 
I know another guy like that too ,from my college 
Similar but more worse than him
7/20/24, 11:15 PM - Aishwarya: So i told if some women chose Muslim men and then something happens to them, I don't care too and they deserve it 

But I meant in terms of mental trauma 
Like cheating, multiple wives etc
7/20/24, 11:15 PM - Sayanth: Yeah u had
7/20/24, 11:16 PM - Aishwarya: Like there is guy called basheer bhashi, he literally has two wives 

And I know a muslim guy who is a neighbour ,his wife had cancer and he remarried before she died
7/20/24, 11:16 PM - Aishwarya: Not after 

Before
7/20/24, 11:17 PM - Sayanth: Tf
7/20/24, 11:18 PM - Aishwarya: And there was a Christian woman who was a neighbor 
She had flee this place coz another neighbor( two muslim men from two muslim neighbor families )caught an affair with a priest ( pallilachan)
7/20/24, 11:18 PM - Aishwarya: Like what she did is wrong
7/20/24, 11:18 PM - Aishwarya: They had planned to catch them at around 2am at night 💀
The dedication 😂
7/20/24, 11:19 PM - Aishwarya: Like this women's husband is in gulf
7/20/24, 11:19 PM - Aishwarya: He seemed like he didn't have a problem with the affair 
Idk 
He and this priest was friends
7/20/24, 11:21 PM - Aishwarya: Plus I have this theory that men who work long away from their wives ,who are a certain type of sexuality ,they cheat on their wives 

Idk, I feel that he has some women in gulf 
Maybe I'm wrong 
Idk
7/20/24, 11:22 PM - Aishwarya: There is another neighbor ( this one is not close neighbor but within 1km)
He had accidentally pregnancy with his brothers wife 💀
7/20/24, 11:22 PM - Aishwarya: He lives peacefully here ,running a shop
7/20/24, 11:24 PM - Aishwarya: His daughter faced more shame than him 
He is probably 60 now

The daughter married away to some guy in palakkad
7/20/24, 11:24 PM - Aishwarya: So likee
7/20/24, 11:25 PM - Aishwarya: Njn udheshiche is ,the women who knowingly chose bad men deserve mental trauma🙂
7/20/24, 11:26 PM - Aishwarya: Like not level 3 mental trauma 
But level 1 ?
7/20/24, 11:26 PM - Aishwarya: It's like punishment for them ,for enabling bad men in society
7/20/24, 11:26 PM - Aishwarya: Does that make sense
7/20/24, 11:27 PM - Aishwarya: Also this is wishful thinking 

Coz thats not how it works 
Several good people get fucked over too 🥺

So wishing karma doesn't really work
7/20/24, 11:28 PM - Aishwarya: Okay let me explain 

Its like , these type of women ruin it for the other women too 
That's why I don't like ,this type of women
7/20/24, 11:29 PM - Aishwarya: Example : a few guys I liked they literally told that ,for guys as long as it's not physical cheating it's not a bad thing at all 

But for women it's not like that
7/20/24, 11:30 PM - Aishwarya: Like women who have boundaries deserve relationships too 
So for most women it's either compromise the boundaries or be single
7/20/24, 11:31 PM - Aishwarya: This is in addition to other difficulties that both genders face to find relationship 

Like they have to find a partner that like them back 
That ofcourse ,men also struggle with that
7/20/24, 11:31 PM - Aishwarya: Plus some of these women flex about it in front of other single women
7/20/24, 11:32 PM - Aishwarya: Alsoo ,i really root for women in healthy relationship btw
7/20/24, 11:32 PM - Aishwarya: Plus it's not that I'm dying to be in relationship 
Actually I don't even have the time 
Plus the interest also ,not much there
7/20/24, 11:32 PM - Aishwarya: But the thing is IF
7/20/24, 11:33 PM - Aishwarya: IF I wanted to be in a relationship, I will have to compromise the boundaries
7/20/24, 11:34 PM - Aishwarya: Ofcourse there will be men who will be understanding of their partners boundaries 

But I'm talking about the majority of men
7/20/24, 11:38 PM - Aishwarya: <Media omitted>
7/20/24, 11:39 PM - Aishwarya: This is a guy I used to kind of like
7/20/24, 11:39 PM - Aishwarya: I don't care about this particular guy
7/20/24, 11:40 PM - Aishwarya: But the fact that majority of guys thinks like this ,is what I don't like
7/20/24, 11:40 PM - Aishwarya: And I feel this sort of behavior is enabled because lot of women put up with this
7/20/24, 11:41 PM - Aishwarya: Coz a lot of guys want to be in relationship too 
Just like women 
So if women had more boundaries ,the men will adjust too 

Just like how men have boundaries
7/20/24, 11:42 PM - Aishwarya: This guy literally said 

'I'm sure my gf wud be sensible to understand the nuances'
7/20/24, 11:42 PM - Sayanth: Tf
7/20/24, 11:43 PM - Aishwarya: Indirectly ,in others words girls like me who have boundaries ,can fuck off 🙂
7/20/24, 11:43 PM - Sayanth: Ok I've got a lot to say but I don't have the energy now I'll reply to all this tomorrow
7/20/24, 11:44 PM - Aishwarya: Okay sure 
No problem
7/20/24, 11:44 PM - Aishwarya: Cya tomorrow
7/20/24, 11:44 PM - Aishwarya: Take rest
7/20/24, 11:44 PM - Aishwarya: Take care
7/20/24, 11:44 PM - Aishwarya: Good night
7/20/24, 11:44 PM - Sayanth: Goodnight
7/20/24, 11:44 PM - Sayanth: Take care u too
7/20/24, 11:44 PM - Sayanth: 🫂🫂💜
7/20/24, 11:44 PM - Aishwarya: 🫂😇
7/21/24, 9:43 PM - Sayanth: heyyy

7/21/24, 10:54 PM - Aishwarya: Batchmateee
7/21/24, 10:54 PM - Aishwarya: Lolll
7/21/24, 10:54 PM - Sayanth: Nope
7/21/24, 10:54 PM - Sayanth: I'm the weird one
7/21/24, 10:54 PM - Sayanth: So it's always me who does weird things with tech
7/21/24, 10:54 PM - Aishwarya: Wtf where did that come from idk💀😭

Anywayssss
7/21/24, 10:55 PM - Aishwarya: Ohhhhh
7/21/24, 10:55 PM - Aishwarya: Come on 
You know it's some talent 🥹
7/21/24, 10:55 PM - Aishwarya: Like the batchmate thing I meant
7/21/24, 10:56 PM - Aishwarya: Likeee 
I was asking about if anyone else in your college did that ,to know how common of a talent it isss
7/21/24, 10:57 PM - Aishwarya: So likee
Have they created non weird tech stuff ???🤔
7/21/24, 10:57 PM - Sayanth: Yeah like u know we have to do projects in final year
7/21/24, 10:57 PM - Sayanth: So yeah like normal tech things
7/21/24, 10:59 PM - Aishwarya: At first i was just watching something on reels 
Edakk current poyi
So I opened my gallery and I have folder for that guy 💀
So I was looking through it 
And I didn't particularly feel any crush type of feeling 
I was like meh 
But I did remember the times I really liked him
Still like him but not much
7/21/24, 10:59 PM - Sayanth: Oh
7/21/24, 10:59 PM - Sayanth: U have folder for him ☠️
7/21/24, 10:59 PM - Aishwarya: Ohh , so you HAD to create something creative ?

Angane aano app create cheyte?
7/21/24, 11:00 PM - Aishwarya: Ohh okay 
I have some doubts will ask later 
About how common creating new tech things is
7/21/24, 11:01 PM - Aishwarya: 😅yaa
I have folder for everything 💀
7/21/24, 11:01 PM - Sayanth: Nope it was just I wanted someone to listen to me or talk to me the same way I do to some one I love
7/21/24, 11:01 PM - Sayanth: So made this
7/21/24, 11:02 PM - Sayanth: It wasn't related to academics
7/21/24, 11:03 PM - Aishwarya: So like I was feeling kinda meh , looking thru that folder 

But then after 3 minutes current vennu 
And I was watching some reels again 
And after 5 minutes ,I got bored and was checking his profile and saw that Japanese girl 
And gradually I started crying lol
And after 5 minutes it stopped
And I wrote it down in my diary 
That this is another reason why I should leave india ,or else I will be stuck in a country where guys are allowed to be whatever ,but girls are slut shamed for every little thing
7/21/24, 11:03 PM - Aishwarya: Ohh🥹
7/21/24, 11:04 PM - Aishwarya: Oh okay
7/21/24, 11:05 PM - Aishwarya: There is some technique used by girls before/after breaking up 
Like they will resent the guy so much ,that it is easy to move on
7/21/24, 11:05 PM - Aishwarya: Like I don't want to move on from him though 
He is the perfect crush material
7/21/24, 11:06 PM - Aishwarya: And if I get insecure ,I can roast him with my bestie
7/21/24, 11:06 PM - Sayanth: Hmmmmm this is sooo confusing
7/21/24, 11:06 PM - Aishwarya: Alsoo ,I have found previously that he had shamed a girl in a group for her looks ( one of the girls he dated)
7/21/24, 11:06 PM - Sayanth: How do u do that teach me
7/21/24, 11:06 PM - Sayanth: Oh
7/21/24, 11:07 PM - Aishwarya: Sooo he did it first
7/21/24, 11:09 PM - Aishwarya: For me ,its like I feel more girly when I have a crush 

But also I just can't like anyone 
I have to atleast feel delusional that I have a chance with that guy 
So it's him 

And my biggest trigger is seeing a dark skin guy lust over or like fair girl( coz skin color is my biggest insecurity)
But since he is fair himself , I don't really feel much 
But since it's a crush and I have feelings for him ,I do feel little bit jealousy depending on my mood
7/21/24, 11:11 PM - Aishwarya: But if it's a dark guy that I like or even just lowkey like ; then him lusting over or liking a fair girl ,triggers all my deepest wounds
7/21/24, 11:14 PM - Aishwarya: I don't feel this with fair guys and especially not white guys for some reason 

There was two guys that I used to sext with ( just twice)

(Alsoo please don't judge okay )

So like I was telling to them about threesome with other girls ( like white ,latin, japanese etc ) and I noticed that I wasn't feeling feeling jealous 

Mainly I was trying to understand what is okay and what is triggering for me
7/21/24, 11:15 PM - Sayanth: Aah noooo
7/21/24, 11:15 PM - Sayanth: I won't
7/21/24, 11:16 PM - Aishwarya: It's easy 

First step is ,ask them out
Get rejected 
Thus the delusion that there is chance with them is killed 
So the crush will be vanished
7/21/24, 11:17 PM - Aishwarya: What does this no stand for 😭

Does it mean ,noo ,this is not good ?
7/21/24, 11:17 PM - Aishwarya: Ya I know you won't judge
7/21/24, 11:17 PM - Sayanth: Nooo I won't judge
7/21/24, 11:18 PM - Aishwarya: Okay🥹
7/21/24, 11:18 PM - Aishwarya: But alsoo 
Idk if it works for everyone 

There was a guy who told me that he don't get crushes on normal people ?
7/21/24, 11:19 PM - Aishwarya: Like he told that his crushes are very attractive celebs etc 

Normal women ( pretty ones too) ,if he likes them ,he asks them out real quick
7/21/24, 11:19 PM - Aishwarya: If she says yes,they date 
If no ,he moves on
7/21/24, 11:22 PM - Aishwarya: Soo idk if it works for guys 

Coz guys just get attracted to any pretty girl 

But attracted to doesn't mean ,they have feelings for them right ?
So I'm guessing when most guys get crush on a girl , they kind of fantasize the potential relationship?( or like them dating in some way )
7/21/24, 11:22 PM - Aishwarya: So like once that girl rejects them ,won't the crush be gone ?🤔
7/21/24, 11:24 PM - Aishwarya: I mean ,they will still find that girl attractive and/or attracted to her 
But the feelings will be gone right ?

Coz I delusion is gone 
( for good ? In a way ?)

Coz it's not productive to have a crush on someone they have no chance with 
( except in situations where they just want to have a crush)
7/21/24, 11:24 PM - Sayanth: Nooo not for me
7/21/24, 11:25 PM - Sayanth: I can't get rid of feelings
7/21/24, 11:27 PM - Aishwarya: Someone just having a crush can be nice 

Just like having fictional crushes 
If I had the ability to have fictional crushes, I would never even try to have a crush on a human male lol 
( unless I want to actively date that person ,coz for many people sex is some more better with persons they have feelings for ; but the trauma will be more too ; which is why I will probably never have even a kiss or makeout with that guy even though I want to ,and there is 100 chance of it happening if I wanted to ,coz he is that easy lol )
7/21/24, 11:29 PM - Aishwarya: Ohh

Maybe try to investigate into the feelings 

It is definitely possible to move on
7/21/24, 11:30 PM - Aishwarya: Like there is this theory that moving on from long term relationships is easier than moving on from short term relationships ( except in situations where the girl has invested so much time ,and her childbearing years was wasted on him ,but the being stuck feeling is not related to romantic feelings though)
7/21/24, 11:32 PM - Sayanth: No that's not true at all
7/21/24, 11:32 PM - Aishwarya: Its because in long term relationships, we have seen them for a long time and we know their ugly side ( like their ugly personality side ,ugly looks side )
7/21/24, 11:32 PM - Sayanth: May be a few percentage but not majority
7/21/24, 11:33 PM - Sayanth: Yeah agree
7/21/24, 11:33 PM - Aishwarya: I mean ,they DONT have feelings for every pretty girl 
Just one girl mostly 

But they get attracted to most pretty girls
7/21/24, 11:34 PM - Aishwarya: Not you 

Majority
7/21/24, 11:34 PM - Aishwarya: Is what I meant
7/21/24, 11:35 PM - Sayanth: No that's not true cuz u can't define beauty everyone has different taste from others so I don't think it's true like I rarely see any pretty girl
7/21/24, 11:35 PM - Sayanth: Not for me
7/21/24, 11:37 PM - Aishwarya: That's youuu
I think no reason for you to lie 

So it's true for you 

That's not how majority guys are 😅

Btw I feel majority girls are probably like that ? I'm not sure 
But it's definitely not uncommon for girls to be like that though 
Even I'm like that 

I can find a guy attractive and not attracted to him 
I'm mostly like that
7/21/24, 11:38 PM - Aishwarya: What guys find attractive is usually the same though 

Again I'm not talking about you
7/21/24, 11:39 PM - Sayanth: How not comprehensible for me tbh
7/21/24, 11:40 PM - Sayanth: Ok
7/21/24, 11:41 PM - Aishwarya: Ya I understand 

I think you are saying the truth 

So I have some doubts 
But I think I have already asked
7/21/24, 11:42 PM - Aishwarya: Which is good
7/21/24, 11:43 PM - Aishwarya: I have more doubt
7/21/24, 11:43 PM - Aishwarya: But can I ask
7/21/24, 11:43 PM - Aishwarya: Do I have permission?
7/21/24, 11:43 PM - Sayanth: What
7/21/24, 11:43 PM - Sayanth: Yes of course
7/21/24, 11:45 PM - Aishwarya: Okay so I know a guy who is attractive and demisexual 

But he later told that he watches porn and likes it ( he said he made his reddit account to watch nsfw stuff at first )

But I didn't understand what in porn he likes though 
Some girls who watch porn say that they don't get particularly turned on by the guy in the porn ,but more by the act
7/21/24, 11:46 PM - Aishwarya: But since he is a guy ,I think what he meant by he likes to watch porn is that ,he gets turnt on by the girls in porn
7/21/24, 11:46 PM - Sayanth: I thought that's how It's for everyone
7/21/24, 11:47 PM - Aishwarya: Thats how means 

The first part or the second part ?

Like you get turned on by girls in porn right?
7/21/24, 11:47 PM - Aishwarya: So like he can do the same in real too right ?

What is the difference 🤔
7/21/24, 11:47 PM - Sayanth: I don't think he gets turned on by just seeing girls at least idk that wouldn't work for me at least
7/21/24, 11:48 PM - Sayanth: Not by the girls but by the acts
7/21/24, 11:48 PM - Sayanth: I guess it's same for everyone
7/21/24, 11:49 PM - Aishwarya: But like most guys when they watch porn ,they imagine they are fucking the girl 

There was survey on this 

Also ,that's why in porn ,guys body is not shown in zoomed way
7/21/24, 11:50 PM - Aishwarya: That's why the male actor in porn ,his face is not that visible 
So that the guy watching, he can imagine him in the place of the male actor
7/21/24, 11:50 PM - Sayanth: Not exactly like most porn videos are made for men by men
7/21/24, 11:50 PM - Sayanth: There are for women too by women
7/21/24, 11:51 PM - Aishwarya: Oh 
Maybe it's like that for you 

I have rarely seen guys says this, on reddit
7/21/24, 11:51 PM - Sayanth: But still that's cuz of the act not by just seeing the girl
7/21/24, 11:51 PM - Aishwarya: Yaa
7/21/24, 11:52 PM - Aishwarya: Ya that I know 

One is catered way more towards men and vice versa
7/21/24, 11:52 PM - Aishwarya: Yaa
For you
7/21/24, 11:52 PM - Aishwarya: And minority guys?

( I know there are guys like that )
7/21/24, 11:52 PM - Aishwarya: From reddit comments lol
7/21/24, 11:53 PM - Aishwarya: But not the majority guys
7/21/24, 11:53 PM - Sayanth: Most people I've seen men complaining that women don't do anything to turn on
7/21/24, 11:53 PM - Aishwarya: https://www.instagram.com/reel/C8a0v8FNKEo/?igsh=MXByenh0OTF5OWp5bw==
7/21/24, 11:53 PM - Aishwarya: I was kind of surprised to hear him say this
7/21/24, 11:54 PM - Sayanth: Why
7/21/24, 11:54 PM - Aishwarya: Like I know that the majority of guys are like this reel 

But i didn't think this guy was like that 

Ofcourse nothing wrong with it though
7/21/24, 11:55 PM - Sayanth: It's not like that at all perhaps in teenage years cuz of the emerging hormones it makes sense
7/21/24, 11:57 PM - Aishwarya: I think it has a term called pillow princess 

But I feel it's mostly the gorgeous looking women who tend to act like pillow princess ( in liberal places too )

Or women who have shame surrounding sex who don't do anything to turn on men  ( in conservative places )
7/21/24, 11:59 PM - Aishwarya: Ya that I know

I meant it continues into 20s also 

I had seen a comment of my crush, saying his libido dropped at 27 
But still he's like this( being horny takes up major part of his thoughts)
7/21/24, 11:59 PM - Sayanth: Oh
7/22/24, 12:01 AM - Aishwarya: I thought so because Joseph annakuty is someone who cares about women's topics 

Usually guys who do that either actually care ( maybe due to having some female family member they cares out or they are just overtly empathetic) ,or they want to act like they are feminists or whatever to get laid 


In his case ,it seemed like the former reason ( like he actually cared)
Plus probably he did it for fame also ( but he probably has a caring side regardless)
7/22/24, 12:02 AM - Aishwarya: There is a lot of topics to become popular

He can easily be anti women and get popular if he has talking skills ,plus luck
7/22/24, 12:02 AM - Aishwarya: So I think he didn't fake his personality
7/22/24, 12:03 AM - Aishwarya: So i was bit surprised when he said this 

Coz guys who are very horny ,it's not in their favor to support things that don't serve them
7/22/24, 12:06 AM - Aishwarya: Like my crush guy ,he is centre left leaning 

So like kind of liberal 

I have heard that some guys support extreme liberal freedom for women like , so that they can get the benefits of that 

But some guys genuinely support women's rights and freedom because they see it as female gender also deserving of the same male gender has
7/22/24, 12:08 AM - Aishwarya: Like the guy I told about yesterday 
He is a very horny and degenerate guy 

So he is able to see so many women naked and half naked ,only because ,it is one the liberal changes that happened
7/22/24, 12:11 AM - Sayanth: Tff
7/22/24, 12:11 AM - Aishwarya: Yaa 
I believe it is difficult for such guys to be not a bad person 

It comes much for easy for guys who are not like that ,to be good people 

Just like for women ,coz women don't objectify men that much 
( even those women who do objectify men ,it's nowhere the same )
When I have heard women talking about men's looks, it's not objectifying men 
It's mostly he's cute ,he has nice abs etc etc
7/22/24, 12:14 AM - Aishwarya: Like for example the comments about celebrities for example 

Women who objectify men ,they usually say they want things to be done to them 
( it can make that male celebrity uncomfortable though, so it comes under sexual harassment too btw )
7/22/24, 12:20 AM - Aishwarya: Yaa ikr
7/22/24, 12:22 AM - Aishwarya: https://www.instagram.com/reel/C9iCt37ge7t/?igsh=dGowczVhbTRyc3Jv
7/22/24, 12:23 AM - Aishwarya: This is why I can't be with the guy or guys, I will be dating in my 30s ; i can't be with him when I'm in my 50s 😭💀
7/22/24, 12:23 AM - Aishwarya: I'm gonna be with an asexual man when I become more old lol
7/22/24, 12:24 AM - Aishwarya: Like I don't want him to be fapping to teenagers ,when me and him are in our deathbed 💀🥹
7/22/24, 12:26 AM - Aishwarya: I know a guy who is looking for a girl to marry ,he literally posts comments on barely legal teens ( the subreddit name is that ,but I think many of those girls are even less than 18)
He is 30
7/22/24, 12:27 AM - Aishwarya: Like I understand that women look the best upto 25 ? 
But like there is lot of age from 18 to 25 
What is the need for him to literally comment on barely legal teens as a 30 year old guy 
It's like he is proud of it even
7/22/24, 12:29 AM - Aishwarya: I mean after 25 also they can look good 
But any particular women's best , generally 

Except in cases they didn't have money and then got job ,and then had glow up ,but thats different
7/22/24, 12:30 AM - Aishwarya: https://www.instagram.com/reel/C9T3MhDtCoO/?igsh=MTB2bG10YjhueXRhMw==
7/22/24, 12:34 AM - Aishwarya: https://www.instagram.com/reel/C9oRbvMIPEE/?igsh=MXJvbDJkb2NrbTcxZA==
7/22/24, 12:37 AM - Aishwarya: Like my crush, he had told that he preferably wants someone 25 above 
Since he is 30
But then I found out the girls who he adds on insta🥲💀
It's all mostly early 20s girls lol
7/22/24, 12:37 AM - Aishwarya: But atleast in his case ,the political correctness is there
7/22/24, 12:38 AM - Aishwarya: Because there are much worse guys like this
7/22/24, 12:40 AM - Aishwarya: I explained all this so that you understand why I have some views on some things 

Without understanding it can come across as I'm simply saying stuff and negative
7/22/24, 12:42 AM - Aishwarya: Also I'm not negative about it coz I have accepted most stuff 
So like I won't be blabbering about it to you ,don't worry 
I have my female friends for that 🥹
7/22/24, 12:43 AM - Aishwarya: But I like I don't want you to think that I'm not a good friend coz I think in certain ways ( which is facts though )
7/22/24, 12:46 AM - Aishwarya: In the sense ,I don't like many? guys ( and girls who support such guys)

But doesn't mean I don't like men 
Or that I'm a hater
7/22/24, 12:48 AM - Aishwarya: In fact I care about good people of both genders 
(So men also ofcourse )
7/22/24, 12:48 AM - Aishwarya: Even like the guy who has the caste views, I have respect for him coz he is not degenerate towards women like some guys I know
7/22/24, 12:49 AM - Aishwarya: So I respect guys who are good 
And so I root for them ( the ones I don't know personally also )
Coz they are not common
7/22/24, 9:15 PM - Aishwarya: Reply evidee
7/22/24, 9:16 PM - Aishwarya: I just told so that you understand my point of views 😊
So I think reply not needed
7/22/24, 9:17 PM - Aishwarya: .

7/22/24, 10:03 PM - Aishwarya: Please message when you are free 😊
7/22/24, 10:04 PM - Aishwarya: I want to know if you got annoyed or is neutral( like you understand) etc
7/22/24, 10:30 PM - Aishwarya: <Media omitted>
7/22/24, 10:34 PM - Aishwarya: <Media omitted>
7/22/24, 10:35 PM - Aishwarya: It's okay to gossip about people we don't like while they are alive ,to a limit 

But this girl has literally died 😢
7/22/24, 10:37 PM - Aishwarya: In the sense ,I don't really care about influencer girls 
But I do feel some type of way of certain girls who do only fans lite type content
So we used to sometimes talk about only fans like girls,that are ruining society even more
7/22/24, 10:43 PM - Aishwarya: Also i understand her point of view ( about the caption)
But this girl is dead now 😢
I think she deserves some respect
7/22/24, 10:44 PM - Aishwarya: https://www.instagram.com/reel/C9MR6WHN0qo/?igsh=aHQ3YzZxYnJ5czR6
7/22/24, 10:45 PM - Aishwarya: Lot of people had commented negative under her instagram reels after she died
7/22/24, 10:49 PM - Aishwarya: Btw I was not asking advice related to my other friendship 
I just wanted to talk about it
7/22/24, 10:50 PM - Aishwarya: Like I expected better from her 
Because that girl literally died
7/22/24, 10:51 PM - Aishwarya: https://www.instagram.com/reel/C1_xrB3pw1m/?igsh=ZGFpZWRtdDdyamww
7/22/24, 10:52 PM - Aishwarya: Plus this girl literally did CA
It's a very tough course right
7/22/24, 10:52 PM - Aishwarya: So it's not like she is making easy money without doing education 
Even if someone is doing that ,it's their wish
7/22/24, 10:54 PM - Aishwarya: Also this I said to say that, I'm lucky to have your friendship because you don't have any hater energy ,as far as I know
7/22/24, 10:54 PM - Aishwarya: I don't know if you are hiding something though 
But there is no need for you to do that
7/22/24, 10:55 PM - Aishwarya: So I think you are a good person and a good friend
7/22/24, 10:56 PM - Aishwarya: So I said some of my views 
So that you can see if I'm a good enough person ,and decide if you want to continue to be friends with me 🙂
7/22/24, 11:00 PM - Sayanth: I'm not
7/22/24, 11:00 PM - Sayanth: See I'm brutally honest
7/22/24, 11:01 PM - Aishwarya: Okayy
That's good
7/22/24, 11:01 PM - Sayanth: My crush just told me she's a Communist
7/22/24, 11:01 PM - Aishwarya: Oh
7/22/24, 11:01 PM - Sayanth: And I just told her I hate commies
7/22/24, 11:01 PM - Aishwarya: Thats bad?
7/22/24, 11:01 PM - Aishwarya: Oh okay
7/22/24, 11:01 PM - Aishwarya: I have not much idea on it
7/22/24, 11:02 PM - Sayanth: Well if I'm gonna be that much honest to my crush do u think I'd lie to u just to make u comfortable
7/22/24, 11:02 PM - Aishwarya: Also I voted for bjp coz i support tiny little bit anti muslim stuff 
Coz Islam is not progressive etc etc
7/22/24, 11:02 PM - Aishwarya: Oh okay 
That's a point
7/22/24, 11:02 PM - Aishwarya: So you are not annoyed with me 🥹
Thanks 😭
7/22/24, 11:03 PM - Sayanth: If I'm gonna talk about my politics it's complicated af
7/22/24, 11:03 PM - Sayanth: I'm gonna piss of all the parties
7/22/24, 11:03 PM - Aishwarya: Oh okay 😂
7/22/24, 11:03 PM - Sayanth: Now gimme 5 mins
7/22/24, 11:03 PM - Sayanth: Lemme read through ur texts
7/22/24, 11:03 PM - Aishwarya: I have no idea about political parties 
Probably a bad and good thing
7/22/24, 11:04 PM - Aishwarya: Okay
7/22/24, 11:14 PM - Sayanth: How is it related hook up
7/22/24, 11:14 PM - Sayanth: !
7/22/24, 11:15 PM - Aishwarya: She meant the title of the video 
Validation overshadows basic safety 
In the sense hookups do have some chances of stds etc
7/22/24, 11:16 PM - Aishwarya: But she knows that I'm not against hookup
7/22/24, 11:17 PM - Aishwarya: I have infact told her that I want to hookup with a cute guy lol 
I had told before that I cut off my one female friend because she wanted a guy that I found for a hookup lol
7/22/24, 11:17 PM - Aishwarya: In the sense, I was not going to go forward with it coz I have to clear my exams first
7/22/24, 11:18 PM - Aishwarya: And this pune friend had two relationships before ( she had sex with both of them )
Meanwhile I have zero
7/22/24, 11:19 PM - Aishwarya: And I dont think I will have time to be in a relationship, because I have to clear another exam to go abroad and that is my priority 
But I want to lose my virginity ,so it will mostly happen via a hookup or similar
7/22/24, 11:20 PM - Aishwarya: She is above average looking and single by choice 
And since she lives in pune ,lot of her female friends irl engages in hookups ,fwb etc
7/22/24, 11:20 PM - Sayanth: I see
7/22/24, 11:20 PM - Aishwarya: I think she is kind of jealous of that 
So she used to send me posts on reddit where girls get std , get pregnancy ,or like got heartbroken coz of that
7/22/24, 11:22 PM - Aishwarya: I also kind of used to enjoy it lowkey
But in a gossip kind of way 
But in my case ,I'm aware that part of it is my jealousy ( I think it is natural human emotion to a point )
7/22/24, 11:23 PM - Aishwarya: Like I have this feeling of wasting my life without doing all this 
So it helped me cope 

But at the same I don't want to do hookups ,coz of the risks 
But I will do it when I want to lose virginity though 
But not on regular 
Bcoz for girls the risks overweight the positives
7/22/24, 11:24 PM - Aishwarya: But when I said that jealousy thing of mine ,she said in her case she is not
7/22/24, 11:25 PM - Aishwarya: Imo people who think that they're are above jealousy are not good ( like they can have other good qualities though )
7/22/24, 11:26 PM - Aishwarya: Likewise there are married people who might feel jealous of people who are single 
Especially considering that many people are not in that happy marriages ( relationships too )
7/22/24, 11:26 PM - Aishwarya: And committed people can feel jealous of people doing hookups
7/22/24, 11:26 PM - Aishwarya: And hookup people can feel jealous of committed people
7/22/24, 11:26 PM - Aishwarya: Etc
7/22/24, 11:27 PM - Aishwarya: Like jealousy is natural ,in something we find value in ,if we don't have it
7/22/24, 11:27 PM - Aishwarya: But acting on the jealousy is the bad thing
7/22/24, 11:28 PM - Aishwarya: Girls jealous of better looking girls for example
7/22/24, 11:28 PM - Aishwarya: Guys jealous of guys who have a relationship with a pretty girl
7/22/24, 11:28 PM - Aishwarya: Or guys jealous of other guys who have multiple pretty girls
7/22/24, 11:29 PM - Aishwarya: These are all natural emotions
7/22/24, 11:29 PM - Aishwarya: To a point
7/22/24, 11:30 PM - Aishwarya: Alsoo , it depends on this 

IF they find value in that
7/22/24, 11:32 PM - Sayanth: Yeah agreed
7/22/24, 11:32 PM - Aishwarya: This made me feel like she will feel rejoiced if I were to die 🥲

Coz I have told her before that I will do hookup to lose my virginity 
But that I told last year though 

This year according to my conversations, she probably thought I'm against hookups 
I hope that ,that's why she said so 🥲
7/22/24, 11:32 PM - Sayanth: And I'm jealous of literally everyone that my crush talks to
7/22/24, 11:33 PM - Aishwarya: Ohh
7/22/24, 11:33 PM - Aishwarya: Like to her female friends also ?🤔
7/22/24, 11:33 PM - Aishwarya: And guys she is not attracted to ?
7/22/24, 11:34 PM - Aishwarya: And guys she has no interest in ,except maybe platonically
7/22/24, 11:34 PM - Aishwarya: Just curious
7/22/24, 11:35 PM - Aishwarya: I remember me wishing my crush a good relationship in april when we say bye to each other 
And then when I texted him in august , he got into a relationship 

I didn't feel jealous
7/22/24, 11:35 PM - Aishwarya: But like I hadn't seen her though, probably that's why
7/22/24, 11:36 PM - Aishwarya: But in my mind ,she was fair though 
But like not that cute 
Probably that's why I didn't feel jealous
7/22/24, 11:37 PM - Aishwarya: He had broken up with her in March this year
7/22/24, 11:37 PM - Sayanth: Nope
7/22/24, 11:37 PM - Sayanth: Idk I'm possessive af
7/22/24, 11:38 PM - Sayanth: Ok here's something I wanna tell u
7/22/24, 11:38 PM - Aishwarya: Oh okay 
Yea girls can later become interested in guys 
That's a possibility for her
7/22/24, 11:38 PM - Aishwarya: Ya
7/22/24, 11:38 PM - Sayanth: U should actually stop thinking about all this
7/22/24, 11:38 PM - Sayanth: It doesn't affect u
7/22/24, 11:38 PM - Aishwarya: But in April I found out something about him and I cried lol 💀😢😂 <This message was edited>
7/22/24, 11:39 PM - Sayanth: So no point in wasting ur energy on those things
7/22/24, 11:39 PM - Sayanth: What
7/22/24, 11:39 PM - Aishwarya: Ya
7/22/24, 11:40 PM - Aishwarya: I found out that he had a fwb who he wanted to be in a relationship with 
He called her cute ,smart etc 

They tried different types of sex including ahegao?( japanese thing )
7/22/24, 11:40 PM - Aishwarya: The cute part and ahegao part is the part which made me jealous 💀
7/22/24, 11:41 PM - Aishwarya: Cute ,yea ofcourse expected
7/22/24, 11:42 PM - Sayanth: Tf that's just a hentai thing not irl right?
7/22/24, 11:42 PM - Aishwarya: It made me think if I will be able to turn him on more than that girl ,or atleast equally 😭💀
7/22/24, 11:43 PM - Aishwarya: Like I think she wanted to do ahegao face during sex 

But I doubt it's her who wanted to try it
Or probably she wanted to do it to turn him on more ,coz she knows he is a weeb
7/22/24, 11:44 PM - Aishwarya: He said about all this in a group 
I stalked it for two days and found out 
I didn't think I would find out about literal sex details
7/22/24, 11:45 PM - Aishwarya: And he was shaming his ex in that group ,for her looks🥲( on another day's chat)
7/22/24, 11:45 PM - Aishwarya: Not directly shaming her looks
7/22/24, 11:46 PM - Aishwarya: But saying ' oh I didn't fall for her ,I settled for her ,never again '
It was another girl ,not the fwb who he wanted make his girlfriend
7/22/24, 11:47 PM - Aishwarya: And this fwb girl was from kolkata 
He studied in chennai
She had came to chennai to do internship back then 
She had a boyfriend in kolkata who was cheating on her 
So she was doing the same 
She and her boyfriend were on and off relationship
7/22/24, 11:48 PM - Aishwarya: He knew about all this 
But continued the fwb because she liked( attracted to) her that much I guess
7/22/24, 11:50 PM - Aishwarya: Idk why he wanted to be in a relationship with her though 
( because he says personality is more important for him )lol 

He made a pros and cons of being in relationship with her  ( to go for it or not )
They later he decided no
7/22/24, 11:51 PM - Aishwarya: I think he thought about relationship with her because she told that she feel like he don't really like her 
( so she probably switched on his caring side)
Idk
7/22/24, 11:52 PM - Aishwarya: But he literally is not someone who has soft corner for any girl 
Let alone a girl with major red flag and who has a boyfriend and is cheating on him ( even though the boyfriend cheated first )
7/22/24, 11:53 PM - Aishwarya: I think he probably wanted the consistent sex with her 
Since she is cute and was good at sex with him ( he is fat ,so not many girls weren't into him probably especially a cute girl )
7/22/24, 11:54 PM - Aishwarya: I felt jealous and bit of a ick for myself when I found out all this ( the ick part because  how and why did I like such a guy ,and what it tells about my love and respect for myself )
7/22/24, 11:55 PM - Aishwarya: But in my defense, he had lied about many things 
So I felt okay about it
7/22/24, 11:56 PM - Aishwarya: Like I had liked some different him
7/22/24, 11:56 PM - Aishwarya: Plus since he shamed that other girl( his ex) ,so coz of it ,I also roasted him with my friend
7/22/24, 11:57 PM - Aishwarya: Because I literally felt like that would have been me 💀🥲 ( like him shaming me in a group)
7/22/24, 11:59 PM - Aishwarya: But these have taught me things I can tolerate and what triggers me 
So that I can look out for it future
7/22/24, 11:59 PM - Aishwarya: Have to see the positives lol
7/22/24, 11:59 PM - Sayanth: Well if it makes u feel any comfortable I still likes my old crush even tho she had called me a creep and some other things
7/22/24, 11:59 PM - Aishwarya: Plus now I don't feel much
7/22/24, 11:59 PM - Sayanth: Yeah
7/22/24, 11:59 PM - Aishwarya: Ohh
7/23/24, 12:00 AM - Aishwarya: Also in my case ,I can move on from him rn if I wanted to

I hope you also reach that point ,I think it is possibly to learn it
7/23/24, 12:01 AM - Sayanth: U are focusing a bit too much on negatives life is short don't waste time on stupid people or worthless things
7/23/24, 12:01 AM - Aishwarya: There are some positives 
I was looking for a crush in 2023 I remember
7/23/24, 12:01 AM - Sayanth: I can't I don't think I ever will
7/23/24, 12:01 AM - Aishwarya: Ya that's true
7/23/24, 12:01 AM - Sayanth: It still haunts me tho
7/23/24, 12:02 AM - Aishwarya: Like I remember forcing to have crush on a guy ,to fully move on from my college crush
7/23/24, 12:02 AM - Sayanth: Hm yeah I did the same but it didn't work well for me
7/23/24, 12:02 AM - Aishwarya: And then later I found out he was born in 2000
I think that's also a reason why I didn't get the crush
7/23/24, 12:04 AM - Aishwarya: Oh
Do you want to talk about it 

Also have you talked about it with your therapist ? Hope she guides you through it 
Although we only can overcome it ourselves, others can just provide support, that's all
7/23/24, 12:04 AM - Aishwarya: Ohh
7/23/24, 12:04 AM - Sayanth: Also again if it makes u feel any better I'll still love her even if she tried to poison me or something
7/23/24, 12:04 AM - Sayanth: I'm delusional
7/23/24, 12:04 AM - Sayanth: Lol
7/23/24, 12:05 AM - Sayanth: Therapist told me to accept that everything is temporary
7/23/24, 12:05 AM - Sayanth: But I crave someone who is constant in my life
7/23/24, 12:05 AM - Aishwarya: Like I went to my mom's facebook and screenshotted stuff from there ; and send it to my phone ;and made a folder 💀
( don't judge okay)

Then later I found his insta too ,that was open account too
But I wasn't getting a crush
7/23/24, 12:06 AM - Aishwarya: Poison ?🤔
7/23/24, 12:06 AM - Sayanth: Yeah hypothetically
7/23/24, 12:06 AM - Aishwarya: Oh okayy
7/23/24, 12:06 AM - Sayanth: Even if she tried to kill me I'd still love her
7/23/24, 12:07 AM - Aishwarya: I didn't understand 

Like deliberately tried to make your mental health bad ?
7/23/24, 12:08 AM - Aishwarya: Kill means 

Doing things which she knows will kill you mentally?🤔

But is that much possible 
I think probably because you are sensible 😭
Sorry to hear this 

Idk what happened really 
But you didn't deserve it
7/23/24, 12:09 AM - Aishwarya: I really can't relate 

But I hope its not effecting your life badly currently
7/23/24, 12:10 AM - Aishwarya: The rejection part I understand 
Especially first love rejections we always remember
7/23/24, 12:11 AM - Aishwarya: In the sense ,it makes us question our self worth 

This happens to many people 
But how they are effected mentally depends on how sensitive they are 🥺
7/23/24, 12:12 AM - Aishwarya: I have moved on from all the guys I liked 
Especially the ones who done me wrong ( in my eyes , it might be subjective though)

So I think it is possible 

Also it is important for mental health
7/23/24, 12:12 AM - Aishwarya: Especially moving on from ones who wronged you is much easier
7/23/24, 12:15 AM - Aishwarya: If it's someone who didn't do us wrong , then moving on is not that easy 

But still possible with no contact ( this is someone from same workplace or college ,hence it's advised not to date from there ,but people usually do though )

And also accepting that not everyone will like us back ( and remembering that we also have preferences and have people we don't like etc )
7/23/24, 12:15 AM - Aishwarya: Yess 
Having that mindset is key
7/23/24, 12:16 AM - Aishwarya: That is natural 
I think most people have that craving 

Understanding that also helped me
7/23/24, 12:18 AM - Aishwarya: But this ,you should really move on from this ( it's definitely possible)

If it's effecting your mental health currently 
Otherwise it's okay
7/23/24, 9:51 PM - Aishwarya: Hey
7/23/24, 9:51 PM - Aishwarya: How are you today?
7/23/24, 10:02 PM - Sayanth: Hey
7/23/24, 10:02 PM - Sayanth: I'm a lot more tired than I was
7/23/24, 10:02 PM - Aishwarya: Oh okay
7/23/24, 10:02 PM - Aishwarya: Gym ?
7/23/24, 10:02 PM - Aishwarya: Due to that ?
7/23/24, 10:02 PM - Sayanth: No
7/23/24, 10:02 PM - Aishwarya: Okay
7/23/24, 10:02 PM - Sayanth: It's my mind
7/23/24, 10:02 PM - Aishwarya: Take rest
7/23/24, 10:03 PM - Aishwarya: Oh

7/23/24, 10:04 PM - Aishwarya: Ya
7/23/24, 10:04 PM - Aishwarya: What are you going to do now ?
7/23/24, 10:04 PM - Aishwarya: Gaming ?
7/23/24, 10:05 PM - Aishwarya: Also ,do you want to talk about it ?
7/23/24, 10:07 PM - Sayanth: Nothing particular
7/23/24, 10:07 PM - Sayanth: It's just idk my insecurities
7/23/24, 10:07 PM - Sayanth: My feelings that's all
7/23/24, 10:07 PM - Aishwarya: Okay
7/23/24, 10:07 PM - Sayanth: Idk
7/23/24, 10:07 PM - Aishwarya: Oh
7/23/24, 10:07 PM - Aishwarya: Okay
7/23/24, 10:07 PM - Sayanth: Just text u

7/23/24, 10:28 PM - Sayanth: Exactly
7/23/24, 10:28 PM - Sayanth: 🤨
7/23/24, 10:28 PM - Aishwarya: Just my insta feed
7/23/24, 10:29 PM - Aishwarya: I usually save videos of girls who look little bit similar to me ,their profile ids
7/23/24, 10:29 PM - Sayanth: 🫣
7/23/24, 10:29 PM - Sayanth: Whyyyy
7/23/24, 10:29 PM - Aishwarya: Plus mental health advice etc 
I save everything in separate folders
7/23/24, 10:29 PM - Sayanth: 🔫🤨
7/23/24, 10:30 PM - Aishwarya: For this not folder ,but I have created telegram channels for saving reels
7/23/24, 10:30 PM - Aishwarya: I was thinking if I should say it or not hehe
7/23/24, 10:30 PM - Sayanth: Whaaaaaaaaaaat
7/23/24, 10:30 PM - Sayanth: Whyyyyyyyyyyy
7/23/24, 10:31 PM - Aishwarya: Coz it can come across as weird 💀
7/23/24, 10:31 PM - Aishwarya: Actually it has helped me with my mental health
7/23/24, 10:32 PM - Aishwarya: Like some of them I find nice looking ,some nice enough, some not so nice etc 
But the common factor is the confidence they have 
And the happiness
7/23/24, 10:33 PM - Aishwarya: And because positive energy is contagious, is another reason why it helped
7/23/24, 10:34 PM - Aishwarya: Not just this btw 
I save all kind of stuff 
Like health, interesting stuff etc
7/23/24, 10:34 PM - Aishwarya: And people overcoming major trauma, even accidents etc
7/23/24, 10:35 PM - Aishwarya: The instagram saved in my tab mostly don't load ,so hence why i made telegram channels 
Plus I can give captions for easy searching option
7/23/24, 10:40 PM - Aishwarya: Btww

7/23/24, 10:51 PM - Sayanth: Um yeah we share almost everything we don't hide things also they wouldn't ask anything that would cross the line
7/23/24, 10:52 PM - Sayanth: I've none like that

7/23/24, 10:54 PM - Aishwarya: Ya 
But I'm not irl friend right
7/23/24, 10:55 PM - Aishwarya: You probably don't have secrets which if leaked might be a problem 
So can share with irl friends 
Usually it's like that
7/23/24, 10:55 PM - Aishwarya: I think *
7/23/24, 11:00 PM - Sayanth: It won't happen
7/23/24, 11:00 PM - Sayanth: Whats the difference
7/23/24, 11:01 PM - Aishwarya: Oh
7/23/24, 11:01 PM - Sayanth: I don't lie
7/23/24, 11:01 PM - Aishwarya: I meant its less risky 
Coz no mutual friends
7/23/24, 11:01 PM - Sayanth: So I don't do things that I'll have to lie about
7/23/24, 11:01 PM - Aishwarya: Oh okay
7/23/24, 11:02 PM - Aishwarya: Doesn't have to be lies though btw

7/23/24, 11:05 PM - Aishwarya: Oh okay
7/23/24, 11:06 PM - Sayanth: No
7/23/24, 11:06 PM - Aishwarya: Okay
7/23/24, 11:19 PM - Aishwarya: 
7/23/24, 11:19 PM - Aishwarya: Heyy
7/23/24, 11:20 PM - Aishwarya: You like which girl more ?

7/23/24, 11:25 PM - Sayanth: Well tbh both look ugly
7/23/24, 11:25 PM - Aishwarya: No way 💀
7/23/24, 11:26 PM - Sayanth: But if u give an ultimatum I think I'd go with the one on the left
7/23/24, 11:26 PM - Sayanth: But still ugly to me
7/23/24, 11:26 PM - Aishwarya: Hmm

7/23/24, 11:28 PM - Sayanth: Whats ur research
7/23/24, 11:28 PM - Aishwarya: Appreciated 🥹
Guys usually brutal honestly inde peril, they say too much truth 
Pakshe cheat cheyyunerathu ath kaanar illa😂
7/23/24, 11:29 PM - Aishwarya: Oh ,just about the guys preferences 😂
7/23/24, 11:29 PM - Aishwarya: Also ,it's interesting
7/23/24, 11:32 PM - Aishwarya: Yk ,ende second crush, he told in front of his friends, about his girlfriend that ,her body kinda nice aan ,but face atra kollilla😕
But atleast he is not a hoe minded guy ,for the most part
7/23/24, 11:32 PM - Aishwarya: Why would he say like that ?💀😭 especially in front of others 
Whether it's truth or not
7/23/24, 11:33 PM - Aishwarya: Pulline enik vere korch guys ne kaal better aayit aann thonniye ,like comparatively
7/23/24, 11:47 PM - Sayanth: Idk may be he's just lacks emotional maturity
7/23/24, 11:48 PM - Sayanth: I don't have that either
7/23/24, 11:48 PM - Aishwarya: Yaaa
7/23/24, 11:48 PM - Aishwarya: Really 🤔
I don't think so

Why you think so ?
7/23/24, 11:49 PM - Sayanth: Idk cuz my mom used to say I've no L in my tongue
7/23/24, 11:49 PM - Aishwarya: That's just the basics btw 
He should have known 
And thought about how his gf would feel
7/23/24, 11:49 PM - Aishwarya: Ohh
7/23/24, 11:49 PM - Aishwarya: L means limit ?
7/23/24, 11:49 PM - Aishwarya: Like you just say whatever comes to mind
7/23/24, 11:49 PM - Sayanth: No L
7/23/24, 11:49 PM - Sayanth: Ell
7/23/24, 11:49 PM - Sayanth: Bone
7/23/24, 11:49 PM - Aishwarya: Ohhh
7/23/24, 11:50 PM - Sayanth: Nakkin Ell illa
7/23/24, 11:50 PM - Aishwarya: Ellu
7/23/24, 11:50 PM - Aishwarya: Okayy 😂
7/23/24, 11:50 PM - Sayanth: Yeah
7/23/24, 11:50 PM - Aishwarya: Why did she tell so ?
7/23/24, 11:50 PM - Aishwarya: Oh brutally honest ?
7/23/24, 11:50 PM - Sayanth: Yeah I think at least 30 enkilum aavm to get emotional maturity for most people
7/23/24, 11:50 PM - Aishwarya: Ath epozhum nallathallaa
7/23/24, 11:51 PM - Sayanth: Yeah
7/23/24, 11:51 PM - Aishwarya: I don't think so
I mean basic empathy nu onum age illaa 
Maybe children can be excluded
7/23/24, 11:51 PM - Sayanth: I mean I'm not gonna do it with evil intentions also I just won't lie I can just choose not to speak
7/23/24, 11:52 PM - Sayanth: Basic empathy yeah
7/23/24, 11:52 PM - Sayanth: But talk cheythu aa flow il angane paranj poyath aayirikkum
7/23/24, 11:52 PM - Aishwarya: Like ithokke basic empathy il verunneya atha udheshiche
7/23/24, 11:52 PM - Sayanth: My dad says things like that about me
7/23/24, 11:52 PM - Sayanth: Like njn padikkilla
7/23/24, 11:52 PM - Sayanth: And stuffs like that infront of others
7/23/24, 11:52 PM - Aishwarya: Oh okay
7/23/24, 11:53 PM - Aishwarya: Oh ,that's bad
7/23/24, 11:54 PM - Aishwarya: Hmm idk
7/23/24, 11:54 PM - Sayanth: Athayirikkum like we don't say stuff like that intentionally unless we wanna hurt them
7/23/24, 11:54 PM - Aishwarya: Btw one reason is to show off
7/23/24, 11:54 PM - Sayanth: Yeah that could be
7/23/24, 11:55 PM - Sayanth: He may have some superiority complex as well
7/23/24, 11:55 PM - Aishwarya: He is little bit cuter than her 

His ex was very pretty
7/23/24, 11:56 PM - Aishwarya: But she broke up with him for another guy 
Idk why though 
Probably less chemistry or something 
Allengil he didn't give enough attention 
She was the one who asked him out ( I think because he had so many qualities on paper)
7/23/24, 11:57 PM - Aishwarya: Not intentionally to hurt 

But it's common sense to know its hurtful 
Especially for girls ( their worth is mostly on looks by society )
But guys get hurt too
7/23/24, 11:58 PM - Aishwarya: Ya ath undayirunnu, kind of 
Especially during the time he dated that very pretty girl 
Anganeya kette
7/23/24, 11:59 PM - Aishwarya: But still better than some other guys from my college 
Especially my best friends ex 💀
7/24/24, 12:00 AM - Aishwarya: He had helped me with some notes 😭 bare minimum 
But there were two guys who lied that they didnt have it
7/24/24, 12:02 AM - Aishwarya: Oh and main thing I liked about him was that he considered girls who weren't in pretty category as humans 
Few guys weren't like that 
( they only talked to girls who are pretty )
7/24/24, 12:04 AM - Aishwarya: I wasn't gonna tell about the crush thing to him 
But I had to ,coz my close friend at the time was hitting on him behind my back
7/24/24, 12:06 AM - Aishwarya: Also when I look back ,it was not a proper crush
7/24/24, 12:07 AM - Aishwarya: But I was doing extra stuff ,just for the plot💀
Like twice I kept his photo on my phone, why studying for an exam with my friend 💀 I think she told that to him 
Idk what I was doing back then💀
7/24/24, 12:34 AM - Sayanth: Now I see why that girl called me a Jada thendy
7/24/24, 12:34 AM - Aishwarya: Oh which girl and whyyy
7/24/24, 12:35 AM - Sayanth: Well u are gonna say the same after few years
7/24/24, 12:35 AM - Sayanth: 12th classmate
7/24/24, 12:35 AM - Aishwarya: Like not in terms of dating 
But talking to non pretty girl classmates
7/24/24, 12:35 AM - Sayanth: She said "she thought i was a jada thendy"
7/24/24, 12:35 AM - Aishwarya: You talk to pretty girls only ?🤔
7/24/24, 12:35 AM - Sayanth: I was asking her for a nite
7/24/24, 12:36 AM - Aishwarya: Few guys only btw 
Were like that
7/24/24, 12:36 AM - Sayanth: Well I've only talked to just one girl in my entire 11th and 12th
7/24/24, 12:36 AM - Aishwarya: Talking only to pretty girls
7/24/24, 12:36 AM - Sayanth: That too cuz I really had to
7/24/24, 12:36 AM - Aishwarya: Oh then okay
7/24/24, 12:37 AM - Aishwarya: Asking her for a nite means 🤭😏


Jk💀
7/24/24, 12:37 AM - Aishwarya: Lol but seriously what that means 
I didn't understand haha
7/24/24, 12:37 AM - Sayanth: Note
7/24/24, 12:37 AM - Sayanth: 😬😬😬😬😭
7/24/24, 12:38 AM - Aishwarya: Oh okay 

Damn the autocorrect 💀
7/24/24, 12:39 AM - Aishwarya: Like it's coz he was out of my league 
Especially becoz of his ex 

So I couldn't be delusional enough to make it an actual crush
7/24/24, 12:39 AM - Aishwarya: That's why
7/24/24, 12:39 AM - Sayanth: How do u know he's out of ur league
7/24/24, 12:40 AM - Aishwarya: Coz he is cute and fair plus financially also better than me
7/24/24, 12:41 AM - Aishwarya: But generally to know that ,have to look at their ex girlfriend
7/24/24, 12:42 AM - Aishwarya: Like a guy can be not out of league but if he had a much better looking ex, then technically that should be considered as out of league
7/24/24, 12:42 AM - Sayanth: Financially yeah ok
7/24/24, 12:42 AM - Aishwarya: Ya
7/24/24, 12:43 AM - Sayanth: U look cute pnne skin tone I still don't think that would be an issue
7/24/24, 12:43 AM - Sayanth: I mean u are pretty
7/24/24, 12:43 AM - Aishwarya: But actually mainly coz of the ex 
Coz financial matters only for serious relationships and marriage I think 
College relationships are usually time pass, can be
7/24/24, 12:43 AM - Aishwarya: 🥹 I want to meet people like this 

So wholesome 🥹
7/24/24, 12:43 AM - Aishwarya: Thanks 🥹

7/24/24, 12:47 AM - Sayanth: There are some people but I doubt you'll find them interesting
7/24/24, 12:47 AM - Aishwarya: Ya true
7/24/24, 12:48 AM - Sayanth: Also I don't want u to befriend anyone else I'm possessive
7/24/24, 12:48 AM - Sayanth: 😭🥹
7/24/24, 12:48 AM - Aishwarya: Do you know any 25 plus age people ?

7/24/24, 12:49 AM - Aishwarya: Can't predict future 🥺🥹
7/24/24, 12:49 AM - Sayanth: She's always busy
7/24/24, 12:49 AM - Aishwarya: Ohh

7/24/24, 12:51 AM - Aishwarya: Alsoo how do you know she is good person

7/24/24, 1:01 AM - Sayanth: And she's scared of relationships so much

7/24/24, 1:03 AM - Aishwarya: Noooo
7/24/24, 1:03 AM - Aishwarya: Ofcourse not
7/24/24, 1:03 AM - Sayanth: She might seem chill outside
7/24/24, 1:03 AM - Aishwarya: That would effects your friendship 
And my friendship with youuu
7/24/24, 1:04 AM - Sayanth: But she's like a fragile glass castle
7/24/24, 1:04 AM - Aishwarya: Plus she is not my vibe
7/24/24, 1:04 AM - Aishwarya: Oh
7/24/24, 1:04 AM - Sayanth: That she's not
7/24/24, 1:04 AM - Aishwarya: Oh how you know 🤔
7/24/24, 1:04 AM - Sayanth: Like there are things she gets triggered by
7/24/24, 1:04 AM - Sayanth: Even her real name
7/24/24, 1:05 AM - Sayanth: She's not comfortable with that either
7/24/24, 1:05 AM - Aishwarya: Oh
7/24/24, 1:05 AM - Aishwarya: Okay
7/24/24, 1:05 AM - Sayanth: Cuz I know u both
7/24/24, 1:06 AM - Sayanth: + she rarely uses any other social media
7/24/24, 1:06 AM - Aishwarya: Okay 
Ya I simply asked coz I was curious
7/24/24, 1:06 AM - Aishwarya: Okay
7/24/24, 1:07 AM - Aishwarya: Okay so I want to say something 
But idk if I should 
For me it doesn't seem personal since I don't know her 
But since you know her personally I shouldn't say it
7/24/24, 1:07 AM - Sayanth: No u should
7/24/24, 1:07 AM - Aishwarya: Okay then
7/24/24, 1:08 AM - Aishwarya: Okay so I just now searched the key word pretty , to look for that comment that I told about
7/24/24, 1:08 AM - Sayanth: And
7/24/24, 1:10 AM - Aishwarya: <Media omitted>
7/24/24, 1:10 AM - Aishwarya: And I saw this
7/24/24, 1:10 AM - Aishwarya: Like the second comment
7/24/24, 1:10 AM - Aishwarya: About entitled pretty previleged bitches
7/24/24, 1:11 AM - Aishwarya: No judgments though 
I also use these words in my mind when I'm angry 😬
7/24/24, 1:11 AM - Aishwarya: But towards specific people though
7/24/24, 1:12 AM - Aishwarya: Also I'm also jealous of pretty girls 
Not always 
But in some situations 
When I see guys I like liking them 
And yea generally also, sometimes
7/24/24, 1:13 AM - Aishwarya: Alsooo ,you don't have say your opinion
Coz she is your friend ,even though not close 
 Just keep it in your mind
7/24/24, 1:14 AM - Aishwarya: Just listen
7/24/24, 1:15 AM - Aishwarya: Since you gave permission to say ,I'm saying 

Also ,I wanted to say this point 
Not related to her 
But like generally
7/24/24, 1:16 AM - Aishwarya: Like this is the reason the friend pool for me is limited :( in female friends also
7/24/24, 1:17 AM - Aishwarya: Also probably her experience is different than me 
In which case its valid 
Otherwise also
7/24/24, 1:17 AM - Sayanth: Ok ik
7/24/24, 1:17 AM - Aishwarya: Like in my experience, pretty girls have always been nice to me
7/24/24, 1:18 AM - Aishwarya: But girls who I look better than (by a bit or more ) ,has said stuff sometimes
7/24/24, 1:19 AM - Sayanth: I see
7/24/24, 1:19 AM - Aishwarya: Because they were jealous I guess 
( I'm saying it in an ego way , jealousy is a natural emotion ,but acting on it is bad )
Few of them chose to act on it
7/24/24, 1:19 AM - Aishwarya: Ya
7/24/24, 1:19 AM - Sayanth: Yeah totally agree
7/24/24, 1:20 AM - Aishwarya: But like for some reason I didn't feel annoyed at them during the time 

But alsoo ,I have cursed them out in my mind later lol , during my low mood states ,many times
7/24/24, 1:21 AM - Aishwarya: But stilll 
I could see their mind 
Also I have more empathy for bad girls usually than bad guys
7/24/24, 1:22 AM - Aishwarya: In the sense , some part of me felt some sympathy for them coz I saw them as victim of beauty standards 

But if the present me would fight back vocally though if it happened again
7/24/24, 1:23 AM - Aishwarya: But the guys who have commented badly on my looks ,the reason for them doing that was different
7/24/24, 1:24 AM - Aishwarya: It was obviously not jealousy as main reason 

Jealousy means the person is facing negative emotions and might bully someone else to feel superior ( or not inferior)
7/24/24, 1:25 AM - Aishwarya: The guy who did it because of their audacity 

Because they thought its okay to comment on girls bodies who don't fit their beauty standards
7/24/24, 1:26 AM - Aishwarya: Or/and to make a 'joke'
7/24/24, 1:27 AM - Aishwarya: So this is why I have respect for all the guys who are not like this 🫡

Bare minimum but yea
7/24/24, 1:27 AM - Aishwarya: Alsoo ,guys get bodyshamed too ,that's another topic
7/24/24, 1:27 AM - Sayanth: Well I gotta tell u something
7/24/24, 1:27 AM - Aishwarya: Yaaa😭
7/24/24, 1:27 AM - Aishwarya: Whatttt
7/24/24, 1:27 AM - Aishwarya: 🤔
7/24/24, 1:28 AM - Sayanth: U should not lower ur expectations or standards
7/24/24, 1:28 AM - Sayanth: Don't compromise
7/24/24, 1:28 AM - Aishwarya: Oh that 

Okayy
7/24/24, 1:28 AM - Aishwarya: Ya
7/24/24, 1:28 AM - Aishwarya: My God
7/24/24, 1:28 AM - Sayanth: Understandable
7/24/24, 1:28 AM - Aishwarya: Okay
7/24/24, 1:29 AM - Sayanth: Second
7/24/24, 1:29 AM - Sayanth: U Don't need a back up
7/24/24, 1:30 AM - Sayanth: I won't leave u unless u ask me to
7/24/24, 1:30 AM - Sayanth: Thirdly you are pretty
7/24/24, 1:30 AM - Sayanth: I'm not saying this to comfort you
7/24/24, 1:31 AM - Aishwarya: At first I thought you were like that at some point 
And then changed 

There was guy who commented on my skin tone when I was in 3rd standard
I used to be very above average in studies back then 

So I think he felt some guilt ,and then in 7 th standard he complimented me thrice or more 
And also called me maneesha koirala💀
7/24/24, 1:31 AM - Aishwarya: Okay
7/24/24, 1:31 AM - Aishwarya: Oh and he was my same skin tone btw

7/24/24, 1:34 AM - Aishwarya: This guy

7/25/24, 11:22 PM - Aishwarya: Because I didn't have the social skills and was the boring friend ,I had to be the good friend 
Sometimes it came naturally 
Sometimes I had to fake it rarely, when I didn't like that friend coz of what they did 🥲
7/25/24, 11:23 PM - Aishwarya: And then it caused built up resentment and I had to cut them off myself hehe

7/27/24, 10:58 PM - Aishwarya: I'm okay
7/27/24, 10:58 PM - Aishwarya: I'm more okay because you are my friend too🥹
7/27/24, 10:59 PM - Aishwarya: I should have met you earlier 🥹
7/27/24, 10:59 PM - Sayanth: 🥺
7/27/24, 10:59 PM - Aishwarya: You have a good vibe about you
7/27/24, 10:59 PM - Aishwarya: Yaa🥹
7/28/24, 10:00 PM - Aishwarya: Hey
7/28/24, 10:00 PM - Aishwarya: How are you today?
7/28/24, 10:18 PM - Aishwarya: Hellooo
7/28/24, 10:19 PM - Aishwarya: Dudeee
7/28/24, 10:19 PM - Aishwarya: I just saw something 😭
7/28/24, 10:19 PM - Sayanth: Hey
7/28/24, 10:19 PM - Sayanth: Badddddd
7/28/24, 10:19 PM - Aishwarya: Are you gonna deactivate your social medias
7/28/24, 10:19 PM - Sayanth: Whaaaaat
7/28/24, 10:20 PM - Aishwarya: 😕🥲
7/28/24, 10:20 PM - Sayanth: Yeah prolly
7/28/24, 10:20 PM - Sayanth: I want to
7/28/24, 10:20 PM - Aishwarya: Then how can I contact you🥺
7/28/24, 10:20 PM - Sayanth: I'll still have WA
7/28/24, 10:20 PM - Aishwarya: Okay then
7/28/24, 10:21 PM - Aishwarya: Btw imo don't delete instagram 😊
You can log onto it from the web
7/28/24, 10:21 PM - Aishwarya: Otherwise all your posts on instagram will be gone right 
Looking back you might regret it you know
7/28/24, 10:22 PM - Sayanth: I've all my pics backed up
7/28/24, 10:22 PM - Aishwarya: But I think deleting temporarily is possible
But it's risky though , kindaa
7/28/24, 10:22 PM - Sayanth: W8 lemme go take my meds
7/28/24, 10:22 PM - Aishwarya: Yaa but the likes etc 
The memoriesss
7/28/24, 10:22 PM - Aishwarya: Okayy
7/28/24, 10:24 PM - Aishwarya: The guy friend I told about ,he had uninstalled his instagram temporarily 
He logs on from web 
Same for reddit ( I think his reddit feed is toxic that's why)
7/28/24, 10:26 PM - Aishwarya: And instagram algorithm can be changed 
I had did it successfully 
Mine used to be at first toxic news around world ,cheating, dating horrors etc 
Then later the algorithm was mental health advice 
Now it's study advice ,mental heath advice, skincare, cooking videos etc ( even though I don't cook now)
The algorithm is kinda wholesome a bit 
But I have put timer on it 
Coz it's a waste of time especially being on instagram for long time
7/28/24, 10:30 PM - Aishwarya: Also ,when I had my previous insta ,seeing lot of posts of people was kinda distracting 
But I think it's related to my adhd
Alsoo ,many of those people weren't really my friends, just classmates 
And then some junior and senior girls who I followed who didn't follow me back, coz they didn't even know me 
It was kinda fun to check all those ,and sometimes negative ,but mostly distracting and time waste
7/28/24, 10:32 PM - Aishwarya: But can mute some of those people you know , don't even have to unfollow 
If that's the problem
7/28/24, 10:34 PM - Aishwarya: Oh andd if the problem is toxic news maybe stop watching it for a while
Like we have our own problems to deal with right 

Too much negative news negatively impacts mental health
7/28/24, 10:36 PM - Aishwarya: https://youtube.com/shorts/dlVGOusKiG8?si=fSDKiXpBUSK2RN0H
7/28/24, 10:36 PM - Sayanth: Yeah
7/28/24, 11:00 PM - Sayanth: Hey
7/28/24, 11:00 PM - Sayanth: Jam???
7/28/24, 11:01 PM - Sayanth: Yeah true
7/28/24, 11:01 PM - Sayanth: I guess may be I should just deactivate it temporarily
7/28/24, 11:03 PM - Aishwarya: Yaa
Link ?
7/28/24, 11:04 PM - Sayanth: Let’s listen and choose the music together in real time.
https://spotify.link/w3SFKhYABLb
7/28/24, 11:05 PM - Aishwarya: Yaa 
Do what works for you 😊
But be careful with deactivating 
I had received a notification that have to activate it again after 3 months I think 
Otherwise the instagram gets deactivated permanently 😕
7/28/24, 11:06 PM - Aishwarya: I can't hear🥹
7/28/24, 11:08 PM - Sayanth: W8
7/28/24, 11:08 PM - Aishwarya: Okay

7/28/24, 11:10 PM - Sayanth: Join again
7/28/24, 11:10 PM - Aishwarya: Also girls use instagram to verify the identity of the guy 
I have heard that advice given on indian cities subreddits and twoxindia 
It will help you in that
7/28/24, 11:10 PM - Aishwarya: Okay
7/28/24, 11:12 PM - Sayanth: I don't want any girl
7/28/24, 11:12 PM - Sayanth: Did u join
7/28/24, 11:12 PM - Aishwarya: It's not opening

7/29/24, 10:10 PM - Sayanth: U know what
7/29/24, 10:10 PM - Sayanth: I did something
7/29/24, 10:10 PM - Aishwarya: Oh

7/29/24, 10:31 PM - Aishwarya: I read it fully
7/29/24, 10:31 PM - Aishwarya: Who is this btw ?
7/29/24, 10:31 PM - Aishwarya: Confused which girl it is
7/29/24, 10:32 PM - Aishwarya: Like the reddit girl who is your crush 
Or previous crush 
Or pinterest girl
7/29/24, 10:32 PM - Sayanth: Previous crush
7/29/24, 10:32 PM - Sayanth: I wanted to know if she's ok
7/29/24, 10:32 PM - Sayanth: And wanted to say a bye
7/29/24, 10:32 PM - Sayanth: For the last time
7/29/24, 10:33 PM - Aishwarya: Oh I kind of thought it's her
She is one who fakely accused you right
7/29/24, 10:34 PM - Aishwarya: Like damn ,why is she replying like that 😐
7/29/24, 10:34 PM - Sayanth: I'd not say accused but she called me creep tho
7/29/24, 10:34 PM - Sayanth: But I guess from her pov it makes sense
7/29/24, 10:35 PM - Aishwarya: Also if she previously told you not to message her ( for whatever reasons or misunderstanding on her end ) ,you shouldn't have messaged her 
But it's not like a crime or something either also ofcourse
7/29/24, 10:37 PM - Aishwarya: Yea I didn't want to say that word again 

Lol you are probably one of the decentest guys 

And even if you said something sexual to her ,it's not a sin you know 
Unless it happened all of a sudden, like 180 degree unexpected turn and she was shocked 
Even then , unless repeated idk it's not a big deal
7/29/24, 10:37 PM - Sayanth: Yeah I shouldn't have but she didn't tell me to not text her just it was cold response and blocked me
7/29/24, 10:38 PM - Sayanth: I didn't
7/29/24, 10:38 PM - Sayanth: I'd always ask her permission whenever I was gonna make a joke
7/29/24, 10:38 PM - Sayanth: Every time
7/29/24, 10:39 PM - Aishwarya: Ya ,if something major happened  before or probably without a reason also ,she can have her boundaries 

If she communicated with you that her boundary ,is you not texting her ,then you probably shouldn't 

But it depends on what happened back then
7/29/24, 10:40 PM - Aishwarya: Is she from very suburbs place ,parents very strict 
Such upbringing?

Maybe she is the opposite of sex positive or something 
Like not even neutral
7/29/24, 10:40 PM - Sayanth: She didn't say that either
7/29/24, 10:40 PM - Sayanth: Parents were strict
7/29/24, 10:41 PM - Aishwarya: I studied in a city 

I didn't have close guy friends coz of my social anxiety ( but I wish I had that level of social skills though)
Like irl the guy friends say outright sex jokes with the girls in the group 
And the girls don't mind 

So it depends on the girl and her upbringing dynamics
7/29/24, 10:41 PM - Sayanth: But we never really talked about it. At least I didn't initiate it. She once asked me if I'm also passionate about boobs
7/29/24, 10:42 PM - Aishwarya: Oh if she didn't tell you not to text her ,then how can you know if before hand 

So you are not at all wrong to text her today
7/29/24, 10:43 PM - Aishwarya: Oh okay 

So you asked her permission and she said yes 

So there is consent 

So NOT wrong at all
7/29/24, 10:44 PM - Sayanth: Everytime I make a joke or pickup line id ask her permission
7/29/24, 10:44 PM - Aishwarya: If it ( the jokes) made her uncomfortable later ,then that's on her 

But out of humanity you can tell sorry to her 


But she don't have the right to call you creep
7/29/24, 10:46 PM - Sayanth: No it's not the jokes but my confession
7/29/24, 10:46 PM - Aishwarya: Oh okay 
Then how can you know not to text her ?

Maybe text her again and ask her this 

See don't allow yourself to be crowded when you are not in the wrong 
It might trigger you later you know ( for me it's like that )

If you are very forgiving, maybe it's different for you
7/29/24, 10:46 PM - Aishwarya: Okay
7/29/24, 10:47 PM - Aishwarya: Damn 🤭

This girl 😏🤣

Sorry I'm kind of laughing 💀
7/29/24, 10:47 PM - Aishwarya: Lol then she did it first
7/29/24, 10:49 PM - Aishwarya: Does she have some sort of a kink or something 🤔

Like setting some sexual vibe and then getting mad about it 
It's giving cnc kink
7/29/24, 10:50 PM - Aishwarya: Also sorry for saying it 
But just my thoughts
7/29/24, 10:51 PM - Aishwarya: In the sense if you feel it's disrespectful to her ,a bittt

But maybe this might be closure for you ,thats why I told so <This message was edited>
7/29/24, 10:51 PM - Sayanth: No I think
7/29/24, 10:52 PM - Aishwarya: Closure in the sense 
You are not a creep 

She literally started a conversation on boobs <This message was edited>
7/29/24, 10:52 PM - Aishwarya: You were not a creep to her 
From what you said
7/29/24, 10:53 PM - Aishwarya: So actually you should be mad at her ,for the fake allegation
7/29/24, 10:53 PM - Sayanth: It doesn't matter I don't care if she calls me creep. I just want to talk to her
7/29/24, 10:53 PM - Aishwarya: Oh then where is the wrong 

There is consent
7/29/24, 10:54 PM - Aishwarya: Oh its the confession that made her uncommon and made her call you a creep?🤔

Did you confess something sexually ? I'm confused now

Or like just confessing that you like her ?
7/29/24, 10:56 PM - Aishwarya: Ya I was half kidding 

But like it seems like she initiated the sexual conversation and is mad at you for saying something sexual ?🤔
7/29/24, 10:58 PM - Aishwarya: Damn 
I'm not understanding why 


Didn't you say you got trauma from her ?
Trauma from her rejecting you ( that trauma is normal )
Trauma in the sense depression 

You had told you got sad from her calling you a creep 
That trauma also
7/29/24, 11:00 PM - Aishwarya: Okay I know that guys try their chance again with girls who are attractive even when they are toxic 

But like, unless it's something for casual , this definitely not gonna do you any good
7/29/24, 11:00 PM - Aishwarya: And from the conversation she seems so uninterested 
So casual or any chance with her don't exist
7/29/24, 11:01 PM - Aishwarya: Did she like you at some point , coz I felt so 
I think should read the chat again
7/29/24, 11:02 PM - Aishwarya: If she didn't like you at any point ,then the probability of her liking you is close to nil

But some girls do later grow into liking guys who they didn't like at first
7/29/24, 11:03 PM - Aishwarya: But why do you want her though 
The conversation seems so toxic 

It's like she is acting as if she is some princess
7/29/24, 11:05 PM - Aishwarya: Also you can't be friends with someone you have feelings for , especially after they rejected you 
Its gonna hurt you when she start dating someone else
7/29/24, 11:07 PM - Aishwarya: My crush didn't reject me ( i think he likes almost any girl, thats one reason why )
7/29/24, 11:08 PM - Aishwarya: Plus I have this thing of being more hurt by certain guys than others 
So he fits that less hurtful crush category 

But still I feel hurt when he likes better looking girls than me
7/29/24, 11:10 PM - Aishwarya: But mostly I'm unbothered by him
7/29/24, 11:11 PM - Aishwarya: But if I were in his same surrounding irl ,that would definitely hurt seeing him all the time ,dating some girl better looking than me
7/29/24, 11:12 PM - Aishwarya: Like the point being ,if you want to move on from someone ,you have to cut off contacts with them fully
7/29/24, 11:12 PM - Sayanth: I just told her I have feelings for her
7/29/24, 11:12 PM - Sayanth: Nothing sexual
7/29/24, 11:13 PM - Aishwarya: I moved on from my college crush like that 

But I rarely check his instagram though but now I don't feel any crush or anything 
Like just for fun 
It's just like checking random other classmates social media ,which I do very rarely
7/29/24, 11:14 PM - Aishwarya: Okay
7/29/24, 11:14 PM - Aishwarya: Okay
7/29/24, 11:16 PM - Aishwarya: None of my crush have acted like im desperate for them ( except the second crush I told about ,but even he later felt guilty )
Or they are better than me ( even when I said things like that sometimes)
7/29/24, 11:17 PM - Aishwarya: I remember my third crush's cousin reassuring me indirectly 💀🥹
Coz I told he is better looking than me 
( I think he told her that and he felt some sympathy or something for me)
7/29/24, 11:18 PM - Aishwarya: Like he actually wasn't that attracted to me ( from some vibes i felt so)

But he was respectful
7/29/24, 11:19 PM - Aishwarya: But this girl is acting as if you are so desperate 
And she acting like a princess 
It's harmful to mental health 
Why do you want any contact with her ???😕 <This message was edited>
7/29/24, 11:20 PM - Aishwarya: Like that conversation pics you send 
I can literally feel the disrespect in third person 😒😕
7/29/24, 11:22 PM - Aishwarya: I think the movies have glamorized guys chasing behind girls ,even after the girl has rejected them 

So it's probably not the same for guys
7/29/24, 11:22 PM - Aishwarya: But most girls would be so gone after the first clear sign of rejection
7/29/24, 11:24 PM - Aishwarya: Even the second crush ,initially he was more nice to me, after he got to know that I had crush on him ,coz he liked the attention 

Later only he was showing attitude
7/29/24, 11:25 PM - Aishwarya: But I think these days guys are given different advice, that not tolerate all this, not chase a girl beyond a point , coz it's disrespectful to the guy
7/29/24, 11:28 PM - Aishwarya: Oh yess it's infact the opposite now I heard 

There is social media trend of pretty girls saying guys no longer pursue them ,but want the girl to pursue the guy 
Idk it's probably true 

I would not know, coz it was always like that for me 💀
7/29/24, 11:29 PM - Aishwarya: Like anyways
7/29/24, 11:29 PM - Aishwarya: You should block her imo
7/29/24, 11:29 PM - Aishwarya: But if I was you ,I would say some things back 💀
And then block
7/29/24, 11:30 PM - Aishwarya: Idk depending on the mood and maturity
7/29/24, 11:32 PM - Aishwarya: Like you can do better ( because she is no good for you )

No matter how pretty she is 
Or no matter how much you like her for whatever reason ,her personality or any reason 
This girl is not worth it
7/29/24, 11:34 PM - Aishwarya: In the sense if I was you ,i would probably call her a slut, for initiating the boob conversation and then calling ME a creep ?
7/29/24, 11:34 PM - Aishwarya: But I would like you to be a good person and handle it with more empathy
7/29/24, 11:34 PM - Aishwarya: That would be to, just block her without insulting her back
7/29/24, 11:35 PM - Sayanth: I'd never insult her I can't hurt her
7/29/24, 11:35 PM - Aishwarya: Okay 🥺🥹
Omg the romance book lead 🥹🤭
7/29/24, 11:36 PM - Aishwarya: That's good
7/29/24, 11:37 PM - Aishwarya: Do whatever works for your mental health 
Blocking or not blocking 

Generally blocking is the way to move on and heal
7/29/24, 11:50 PM - Aishwarya: Okay so
7/29/24, 11:51 PM - Aishwarya: Whatever works for her mental health also 
You have to consider that too
7/29/24, 11:51 PM - Aishwarya: I didn't understand the full context 
Only limited information I know
7/29/24, 11:52 PM - Aishwarya: She told triggering for her right
7/29/24, 11:52 PM - Aishwarya: In the conversation
7/29/24, 11:53 PM - Aishwarya: I thought she just don't want to talk to you because for some reason you are frustrating to her
7/29/24, 11:54 PM - Aishwarya: And she don't want to talk to you ,because she don't want to hurt you again by rejecting you again probably
7/29/24, 11:55 PM - Aishwarya: Probably there is more 
Which you don't have to tell me
7/29/24, 11:56 PM - Aishwarya: But you have to consider her mental health too 
I feel like talking to her is making you kinda happier or probably helping you in some way
7/29/24, 11:56 PM - Aishwarya: Like you have consider her mental health , more than your feeling for her and how she makes you feel
7/29/24, 11:57 PM - Aishwarya: Depending on if you texting her, is effecting her mental health badly <This message was edited>
7/29/24, 11:58 PM - Aishwarya: Maybe it's not effecting her badly 
The chat is confusing for a third person to read ,hence I probably misunderstood
7/29/24, 11:59 PM - Aishwarya: Anyways
7/29/24, 11:59 PM - Aishwarya: I just meant that
7/30/24, 12:00 AM - Aishwarya: To consider her mental health too
7/30/24, 12:02 AM - Aishwarya: Alsoo ,I don't really care 
Coz I don't know her personally
7/30/24, 12:03 AM - Aishwarya: I just told since I thought you might want a third person's insight 
Since you send that chat pics
7/30/24, 12:06 AM - Aishwarya: So don't feel any negative because of my opinion ,okay

I just told since I thought ,you  wanted a third person opinion on this

7/30/24, 10:12 PM - Aishwarya: I didn't feel so reading the chats you send 😬

But yea ,only you can know how you feel right ,more accurately
7/30/24, 10:13 PM - Aishwarya: Okay so what updates about the current crush ?
7/30/24, 10:13 PM - Aishwarya: Did you ask for her pics ?
7/30/24, 10:14 PM - Aishwarya: It was long time ago ,when I asked previously about it 
So I can't remember
7/30/24, 10:14 PM - Sayanth: Remember when I told u that I might be asexual
7/30/24, 10:15 PM - Sayanth: Cuz I never sexualized my crush
7/30/24, 10:15 PM - Aishwarya: Yaa i remember 
And you told that you are a late bloomer sorta
7/30/24, 10:16 PM - Aishwarya: Yaa but that doesn't mean you are a asexual
7/30/24, 10:16 PM - Aishwarya: Alsoo let me tell something 

Don't take it negatively okayy?
7/30/24, 10:16 PM - Aishwarya: I got remembered of my third crush's situation
7/30/24, 10:17 PM - Aishwarya: It's like girls don't want to be outright sexualised ,that's true
7/30/24, 10:17 PM - Aishwarya: But like your present crush ,she might not be asexual
7/30/24, 10:18 PM - Aishwarya: So like ,you should gradually discuss it with her 

If she likes you back, that is
7/30/24, 10:18 PM - Aishwarya: Btw I think you are not asexual
7/30/24, 10:19 PM - Sayanth: W8
7/30/24, 10:19 PM - Aishwarya: Okay

7/30/24, 10:26 PM - Aishwarya: That's good
7/30/24, 10:26 PM - Aishwarya: It's always good to part ways on good terms
7/30/24, 10:27 PM - Sayanth: Dude I love her so much I still miss her idk why I fell for her she's not my type at all
7/30/24, 10:27 PM - Aishwarya: Looking back also that will be a good feeling
7/30/24, 10:27 PM - Aishwarya: Okay
7/30/24, 10:27 PM - Aishwarya: Oh okay
7/30/24, 10:27 PM - Sayanth: It's ok even if u do I don't really care what someone else thinks about me
7/30/24, 10:28 PM - Aishwarya: Okay yea things like that happen 
But she toxic also 

I have heard girls falling for toxic guys ( not coz of looks factor)
But not guys yet
7/30/24, 10:28 PM - Sayanth: It was more like may be best friend kinda thing like I never wanted to leave her that's all I wished for
7/30/24, 10:28 PM - Aishwarya: Okay 😬

7/30/24, 10:29 PM - Aishwarya: Oh 🥹
7/30/24, 10:29 PM - Sayanth: No but she gave me her insta
7/30/24, 10:29 PM - Aishwarya: Okay

7/30/24, 10:31 PM - Aishwarya: Oh 🥹 thats wholesome 

Coz most guys are not like that 

They leave at the first sign of 'perceived' crossing of boundaries 🥲 ; when they are the ones who crossed the boundaries first 😒
7/30/24, 10:32 PM - Sayanth: Current crush she's literally the girl from my dreams unlike the other one
7/30/24, 10:32 PM - Aishwarya: But like nothing uncommon 
Coz many girls are like that 🥹
Why can't guys also be like that 🥺🥹
7/30/24, 10:33 PM - Aishwarya: Okay 🥹
That's good
7/30/24, 10:34 PM - Sayanth: So yeah I knew I'd fall for her once I moved on from my first crush from the very first moment I met her
7/30/24, 10:34 PM - Aishwarya: Yea then chose her ,she is the one good for your mental health it seems 

But don't get attached to her ,without knowing if she likes you back or not 

It might become another depression for you
7/30/24, 10:34 PM - Sayanth: And rn I think I kinda accepted she will never reciprocate my feelings
7/30/24, 10:34 PM - Aishwarya: Oh nice 
That's good
7/30/24, 10:34 PM - Sayanth: Well she said no as well
7/30/24, 10:35 PM - Sayanth: 🫠
7/30/24, 10:35 PM - Aishwarya: Oh
7/30/24, 10:35 PM - Sayanth: Now it's more like the pain of losing a good friend I guess
7/30/24, 10:36 PM - Aishwarya: Oh 
Kinda same for my crush too 

But during that time also I had another crush 💀kinda
So I was not attached 
Plus lot of other things going on
7/30/24, 10:36 PM - Aishwarya: Oh okay
7/30/24, 10:37 PM - Sayanth: Imma go to himalayas
7/30/24, 10:37 PM - Sayanth: And be a Buddhist monk
7/30/24, 10:37 PM - Aishwarya: Always know that such other good friends exists too ,you will find them 

Have abundance mindset 
Its key for mental health
7/30/24, 10:38 PM - Aishwarya: Yaa you can go there for a change and return back 
There are many famous people even ,who did that
7/30/24, 10:42 PM - Sayanth: I won't come back
7/30/24, 10:42 PM - Aishwarya: What

On reddit I think
7/30/24, 10:55 PM - Sayanth: Yeah ik but I guess mostly because of their movie characters that's prolly why we see them like that

7/31/24, 10:19 PM - Aishwarya: Here's a song I came up with:

*Title:* "Aishu, My Starlight"

*Verse 1:*
In the evening's golden glow
I see your smile, my heart starts to glow
Your eyes shine bright like diamonds rare
Aishu, my love, you're beyond compare

*Chorus:*
You're my starlight on a darkest night
Guiding me home with your lovely light
With every breath, I'll love you till the end
Aishu, my heart beats for you, my friend

*Verse 2:*
Your laughter echoes, a sweet serenade
Your kindness and beauty, a heart parade
In your presence, I feel so alive
Aishu, my love, you're my forever drive

*Chorus:*
You're my starlight on a darkest night
Guiding me home with your lovely light
With every breath, I'll love you till the end
Aishu, my heart beats for you, my friend

*Bridge:*
Through life's ups and downs, I'll be by your side
Together we'll dance, under the starry tide
Forever and always, my love will shine
Aishu, my heart belongs to you, my Valentine

*Chorus:*
You're my starlight on a darkest night
Guiding me home with your lovely light
With every breath, I'll love you till the end
Aishu, my heart beats for you, my friend

I hope you like it!

- What's her favorite color?
- Does she have a favorite hobby or interest?
- What's her personality like? (e.g. bubbly, kind, adventurous)
- Is there a special memory or moment you'd like to capture in the song or portrait?

7/31/24, 10:56 PM - Aishwarya: Okay
7/31/24, 10:57 PM - Aishwarya: 
7/31/24, 10:57 PM - Sayanth: Choose one
7/31/24, 10:57 PM - Aishwarya: Which voice did you select?
Do you remember?
7/31/24, 10:57 PM - Sayanth: It was male voice that's all I remember
7/31/24, 10:58 PM - Aishwarya: Oh okay
7/31/24, 10:58 PM - Aishwarya: Can it be changed later ?
Any idea ?
7/31/24, 10:58 PM - Aishwarya: I like ember
7/31/24, 10:59 PM - Aishwarya: But I feel like his voice is bit too rasp 
Might get ear pain if I listen for long time 
Will there be option to change in that case ?
7/31/24, 11:01 PM - Aishwarya: Breeze sounds kinda gay 
Juniper sounds a bit like a girl
7/31/24, 11:01 PM - Sayanth: I think yeah
7/31/24, 11:01 PM - Aishwarya: I have always wanted a gay guy friend 🥹
7/31/24, 11:01 PM - Aishwarya: Oh okay then 
That's good

7/31/24, 11:03 PM - Sayanth: Sus

7/31/24, 11:12 PM - Aishwarya: Yaa
7/31/24, 11:12 PM - Aishwarya: Since when was the audio also available?
7/31/24, 11:13 PM - Sayanth: 2 months back
7/31/24, 11:13 PM - Sayanth: or 3\
7/31/24, 11:13 PM - Aishwarya: Oh okay
7/31/24, 11:13 PM - Aishwarya: Nice
7/31/24, 11:17 PM - Aishwarya: Chatpgt's malayalam audio🤭
7/31/24, 11:17 PM - Aishwarya: But will become pro at it later probably 🥹
7/31/24, 11:19 PM - Sayanth: Yeah ik
8/1/24, 4:37 PM - Sayanth: Heyy
8/1/24, 5:20 PM - Aishwarya: Heyy
8/1/24, 5:20 PM - Aishwarya: How are you ?
8/1/24, 6:58 PM - Sayanth: Bad
8/1/24, 6:59 PM - Sayanth: I'm depressed again
8/1/24, 6:59 PM - Sayanth: Idk whyyy
8/1/24, 6:59 PM - Sayanth: 🥺🥺🥺
8/1/24, 6:59 PM - Aishwarya: Oh🥺
8/1/24, 6:59 PM - Aishwarya: There must be some reason right
8/1/24, 6:59 PM - Aishwarya: Figure out what it is
8/1/24, 7:00 PM - Aishwarya: Then follow the advice on your whatsapp profile
8/1/24, 7:00 PM - Aishwarya: Easier said than done
8/1/24, 7:00 PM - Aishwarya: But still
8/1/24, 7:00 PM - Aishwarya: 🥺
8/1/24, 7:00 PM - Sayanth: I can't 🙂
8/1/24, 7:01 PM - Sayanth: I tried
8/1/24, 7:01 PM - Aishwarya: For example some of my issues is related to the dad thing and then second its my career and third it's related to dating
8/1/24, 7:02 PM - Aishwarya: The first one it is alright now 
But that's the one ,which makes me sad for some reason when i feel like some minor sign of it happening
8/1/24, 7:03 PM - Aishwarya: But I have made the decision and told my parents ,I will move out if something happens again 
And they will have to give me rent till I become financially independent
8/1/24, 7:05 PM - Aishwarya: And then the career thing , I have to clear the exam and then go abroad 
Or without it 
But without it the struggle will be much more 
So I have stress in that 
But I try to consciously remember that stressing out doesn't change the outcomes
8/1/24, 7:06 PM - Aishwarya: And then the dating thing 
I remember that almost everyone goes through it 
Attractive people have it easier 
But they also have their problems but atleast they get to experience 'love' though, even though atleast sometimes there is toxic parts also which exists in the relationship or dating
8/1/24, 7:07 PM - Aishwarya: Plus I know some above average looking girls who have relationship problems or are single by choice ( because of past toxic dating ,now they are more selective)
8/1/24, 7:07 PM - Aishwarya: I'm guessing in your case it's the dating thing right
8/1/24, 7:08 PM - Aishwarya: Probably other stuff too
8/1/24, 7:09 PM - Aishwarya: Idk if it's a good way to deal with it ,but this way of thinking helps me personally 
That many of these kind of problems almost everyone has
8/1/24, 7:10 PM - Sayanth: Not dating
8/1/24, 7:10 PM - Sayanth: Sometimes I feel like I'm desperate for some love
8/1/24, 7:11 PM - Sayanth: I want someone who would see me as their 1st priority
8/1/24, 7:11 PM - Sayanth: Like I wanna have someone who's constant in my life
8/1/24, 7:11 PM - Aishwarya: Okay so does friendship count ?
8/1/24, 7:12 PM - Sayanth: Yes
8/1/24, 7:12 PM - Sayanth: But it's like I don't want to be someone's option
8/1/24, 7:12 PM - Sayanth: Or backup
8/1/24, 7:12 PM - Aishwarya: Because currently I actually like you after me and my mom 
I like the friendship 
And I like you as a person
8/1/24, 7:12 PM - Sayanth: It's like either their 1st or nothing at all
8/1/24, 7:13 PM - Aishwarya: Idk I like my bro but mostly because he is related
8/1/24, 7:14 PM - Aishwarya: But this can change if I meet another good friend 
Which I won't anytime soon 

Plus I will still like your friendship too
8/1/24, 7:15 PM - Aishwarya: I think most people operate in putting themselves first 
Except maybe good moms and maybe good dads too 
Coz they are parents
8/1/24, 7:16 PM - Aishwarya: Even in romantic relationships, the person might be an option 

Actually in romantic relationships it's more likely that the person might be an option ,especially in this era
8/1/24, 7:17 PM - Sayanth: But idk
8/1/24, 7:17 PM - Sayanth: I Don't want that
8/1/24, 7:18 PM - Sayanth: I'd rather be a no one than their someone
8/1/24, 7:18 PM - Aishwarya: I recently got to know of a therapist girl who has a boyfriend 

She was kinda 'falling in love' with her guy friend 

I think that happened coz she used to spend lot of time with him AFTER she started liking him 

Like it didn't happen accidentally imo
8/1/24, 7:19 PM - Aishwarya: If a therapist  ,that too a female is like this ,idk what that tells about dating these days
8/1/24, 7:19 PM - Sayanth: Yeah
8/1/24, 7:19 PM - Sayanth: But I can't be like that
8/1/24, 7:20 PM - Sayanth: I want someone who is constant in my life
8/1/24, 7:22 PM - Aishwarya: Ya most probably you are not like that 

But it will need lot of luck to find such a girl 

So you have to have the mindset of, if it happens then good ( and start taking actions to get that, meanwhile)
Plus have the mindset that if you don't find that , you will do fine too
8/1/24, 7:24 PM - Aishwarya: Plus in friendships too ,if the friend gets into a relationship, their priority will be that partner
8/1/24, 7:24 PM - Aishwarya: In relationship, the partner will make you the priority 
But if something goes wrong, it comes with a lot of trauma
8/1/24, 7:25 PM - Aishwarya: And the trauma is much more who were too attached, to the said partner
8/1/24, 7:26 PM - Aishwarya: And if you have good parents, they have the potential to make you a priority 
You said friendship also counts right
8/1/24, 7:26 PM - Sayanth: Yeah
8/1/24, 7:26 PM - Sayanth: Idk I'm feeling low
8/1/24, 7:26 PM - Sayanth: I don't feel like doing anything
8/1/24, 7:29 PM - Aishwarya: Thats natural 
Some people have more resilience , so even when they are sad, they push themselves to do stuff

And some people have less sensitive mind to begin with
8/1/24, 7:31 PM - Aishwarya: What do you want to do , that you are not able to do ?

Is it related to studies ? Going to gym ?

Initially find the positives of it and force yourself to do it in moderation 

Then it will become a habit
8/1/24, 7:32 PM - Sayanth: I can't do anything
8/1/24, 7:32 PM - Sayanth: I'm sitting here
8/1/24, 7:32 PM - Sayanth: I got assignments to submit
8/1/24, 7:33 PM - Aishwarya: Oh okay
8/1/24, 7:33 PM - Aishwarya: When is the due date ?
8/1/24, 7:33 PM - Aishwarya: To submit those ?
8/1/24, 7:34 PM - Sayanth: tonight i guess
8/1/24, 7:38 PM - Aishwarya: I wish that things I know now I knew when I was younger 
But during those times either so much of life advice were not so mainstream or I didn't come across it 

One of the things that I wish I had done was that I focused more on studies 
And less on friend breakups and crushes etc 
Coz I literally don't have contact with any of them now 
Plus most people come and go 

But I do like the good times I spend partying(a bit), going out eating junk food(during my second year mostly) etc 
Bcoz its better to do unhealthy habits in early 20s ,so that fomo will also be less 
One thing I didn't do is date or have sex ,so I have fomo of that 
Even though I know that ,personally for me ,even if I did that it would not have been good for me overall 
So not much fomo there 
But still some what if, is there ,very rarely

8/2/24, 10:20 PM - Sayanth: what u doinggggg
8/2/24, 10:21 PM - Aishwarya: Ohhh🥹🥳👏
8/2/24, 10:21 PM - Aishwarya: I had went downstairs and just came back
8/2/24, 10:21 PM - Aishwarya: My Delhi friend texted 
After months
8/2/24, 10:22 PM - Sayanth: whyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyy
8/2/24, 10:22 PM - Sayanth: 😠
8/2/24, 10:22 PM - Aishwarya: She said something, and I felt something off 
I was thinking whether to straight up block her
8/2/24, 10:22 PM - Aishwarya: But it was a misunderstanding I think
8/2/24, 10:22 PM - Sayanth: hmmm
8/2/24, 10:22 PM - Aishwarya: Soo
8/2/24, 10:22 PM - Aishwarya: Normal
8/2/24, 10:22 PM - Aishwarya: Just texted back
8/2/24, 10:23 PM - Sayanth: i see
8/2/24, 10:23 PM - Sayanth: like whaaaat
8/2/24, 10:23 PM - Aishwarya: And I had missed an instagram reel she send in may ,so I send her a reel back today ,after she texted on whatsapp
8/2/24, 10:23 PM - Sayanth: i seeeeeeeeeea
8/2/24, 10:24 PM - Aishwarya: She just asked 'are you any closer to moving out '

And I took it negatively lol
8/2/24, 10:24 PM - Sayanth: oh
8/2/24, 10:24 PM - Aishwarya: Oh! Whatever's good for your mental health

Previously she had said like this ,in May 
That also I took negatively kinda
8/2/24, 10:25 PM - Aishwarya: I was telling her that I don't watch reels anymore ( actually I just didn't want to send her reels anymore )
8/2/24, 10:26 PM - Aishwarya: I was not able to say if she said that mockingly or because she cares about me


Probably an in between, so i let it go
8/2/24, 10:27 PM - Aishwarya: But I don't send reels to anyone though 
Previously I used to 
To few friends
8/2/24, 10:28 PM - Aishwarya: Like no particular reason 
Just got bored
8/2/24, 10:29 PM - Aishwarya: 
8/2/24, 10:31 PM - Aishwarya: I'm friends with her ,but like I didn't want to be close friends anymore 

Because I couldn't look past something that happened the first week of meeting her
8/2/24, 10:32 PM - Aishwarya: Like, she wanted to date, some guy that I liked
8/2/24, 10:33 PM - Sayanth: its ok perhaps some day u might perhaps u dont but its ok thats totally normal
8/2/24, 10:33 PM - Aishwarya: Yaa
8/2/24, 10:33 PM - Sayanth: i dont think she was mocking
8/2/24, 10:33 PM - Sayanth: prolly
8/2/24, 10:33 PM - Aishwarya: Ya most probably not mocking
8/2/24, 10:35 PM - Aishwarya: So when me and her last talked in May 
I kind of indirectly told about it ( like I told that the girls who don't try to take other girl's guys are green flags😬)
I felt like she got offended 
Idk
8/2/24, 10:36 PM - Aishwarya: So after that happened, whatever she say ,I have some doubts if she is trying to offend me 
That's all 
So I stopped the friendship fully 
But maybe I can contact with her later
8/2/24, 10:38 PM - Aishwarya: Like this happened in May 2024

What she did happened in June 2023 
So almost a year ago 

She had no idea that I had issues with what she did back then 

We were really close all those time 
But then later I met some other friends and that's when I realised that I only want friends who I reel safe with ,atleast as of now
8/2/24, 10:39 PM - Sayanth: yeah relatable and understandable
8/2/24, 10:39 PM - Sayanth: i mean id not talk to u if i dont feel really safe with u
8/2/24, 10:40 PM - Aishwarya: Actually I didn't want to vent about what happened today
8/2/24, 10:40 PM - Aishwarya: But idk just said in a flow
8/2/24, 10:40 PM - Aishwarya: Yaaa
8/2/24, 10:40 PM - Aishwarya: Okay 🥹
8/2/24, 10:41 PM - Aishwarya: Lot of people befriend people who they secretly despice, idk how 😭

My sensitive mind could never
8/2/24, 10:41 PM - Sayanth: same i cant
8/2/24, 10:42 PM - Aishwarya: Maybe not a lot 
But many
8/2/24, 10:42 PM - Aishwarya: Yaa🫂
8/2/24, 10:42 PM - Aishwarya: Like online etc can just block or something 
Irl it sucks 😭

Damn it's such an extroverted world
8/2/24, 10:43 PM - Aishwarya: Got remembered of my college 💀
8/2/24, 10:43 PM - Aishwarya: A bitt
8/2/24, 10:44 PM - Sayanth: ik almost all my classmates were like thattttt
8/2/24, 10:44 PM - Aishwarya: Nice 💀🤭
8/2/24, 10:46 PM - Aishwarya: Is it part of your academics?
8/2/24, 10:51 PM - Aishwarya: Btw do you mind me asking about such stuff ?
Probably no right
8/2/24, 10:51 PM - Aishwarya: It's just that I admire tech peoples
8/2/24, 10:52 PM - Aishwarya: And their works
8/2/24, 10:52 PM - Aishwarya: Especially if it's someone I know
8/2/24, 10:53 PM - Aishwarya: My pune friend did engineering too 
But she really doesn't like her work 
I don't dislike her because of it 
But I like special liking for people who atleast don't hate their work
8/2/24, 10:56 PM - Aishwarya: But it depends, if I don't like that person ,everything they do ,is lowkey annoying 
Example my dad is passionate about his career and likes his work
8/2/24, 11:04 PM - Aishwarya: Also doesn't really matter actually 
Coz I think probably not many people like their work 
And I read somewhere people who work a lot tend to be narcissistic 🤔
It depends on why they work though ( if they work coz they like the work or because they wanna be seen as 'successful'
8/2/24, 11:05 PM - Aishwarya: I kind of had an admiration for IIT people
8/2/24, 11:06 PM - Aishwarya: But I met a guy on reddit last year, which changed my perspective a bit🤭
It's like, he had a porn addiction and like some of the stuff he watched ,it's mutilation porn☠️
8/2/24, 11:07 PM - Aishwarya: Met in the sense ,just a random conversation
8/3/24, 12:37 AM - Sayanth: Hey u there
8/3/24, 12:37 AM - Sayanth: Sorry
8/3/24, 12:37 AM - Sayanth: Nopeee
8/3/24, 12:37 AM - Sayanth: Dude u can ask me anything
8/3/24, 12:37 AM - Sayanth: Literally anything
8/3/24, 12:37 AM - Sayanth: Except my passwords
8/3/24, 12:38 AM - Sayanth: Oh I mean engineering requires tooo much brain power like it's actually sooo draining makes u all tired just by thinking
8/3/24, 12:39 AM - Sayanth: I don't like. I would have but now that I realized that rat race isn't something that worth sacrificing ur life
8/3/24, 3:55 PM - Aishwarya: I fell asleep 😴

8/3/24, 10:19 PM - Sayanth: There's nothing
8/3/24, 10:19 PM - Aishwarya: Ya I know😭
8/3/24, 10:19 PM - Aishwarya: I hope you find a way to manage during tough times🥺
8/3/24, 10:23 PM - Aishwarya: Talk to your loved ones , you don't have any :(

8/5/24, 11:58 PM - Aishwarya: I was waiting for updates
8/5/24, 11:58 PM - Sayanth: <Media omitted>
8/5/24, 11:58 PM - Sayanth: <Media omitted>
8/5/24, 11:58 PM - Sayanth: <Media omitted>
8/5/24, 11:58 PM - Sayanth: <Media omitted>
8/5/24, 11:58 PM - Sayanth: <Media omitted>
8/5/24, 11:58 PM - Sayanth: <Media omitted>
8/5/24, 11:58 PM - Sayanth: Here
8/5/24, 11:58 PM - Aishwarya: Okay
8/6/24, 12:01 AM - Aishwarya: I can't feel it 
I don't think I ever will 
Means ?

Is she aromantic 

Or like she is trying to rejecting you politely
8/6/24, 12:01 AM - Sayanth: Idk
8/6/24, 12:02 AM - Sayanth: She's saying she doesn't feel love or such things
8/6/24, 12:02 AM - Sayanth: Or never even had a crush
8/6/24, 12:03 AM - Aishwarya: From other messages ,she does seem to care about you 
But it's probably platonic 
But not clear 

But many girls do tend to like the guy later on
8/6/24, 12:03 AM - Aishwarya: And you are a green flag ( comparatively atleast)
So why can't she give you a chance 🤔
8/6/24, 12:03 AM - Aishwarya: Oh 🤔
8/6/24, 12:04 AM - Sayanth: Well in my case I love her too much it's just I wanna spend all my life talking to her
8/6/24, 12:04 AM - Aishwarya: That borders aromantic 🤔

Most people have atleast one crush by the age of 20 

It is after that ,they have less crush or crushes
8/6/24, 12:04 AM - Sayanth: Tell me my redflags
8/6/24, 12:04 AM - Sayanth: Yeah I guess
8/6/24, 12:05 AM - Sayanth: But I'm ok with it I love her for she is now .
8/6/24, 12:06 AM - Aishwarya: Okay 
That is understandable 

Some people while they love want to spend so much time with that person 
Some people less time 

Seems likes she is less time kinda person, but it's usually guys who are like that ( kind of the opposite of anxious attachment )
8/6/24, 12:06 AM - Aishwarya: Let me think
8/6/24, 12:08 AM - Aishwarya: Okay so as a friend, you always reply me late 
Which I understand 
Coz I'm also like that 
And the time delay period depends on the person who I'm messaging to 

But from how you talk to your crush, it's not like that 
So that is not a red flag
8/6/24, 12:08 AM - Aishwarya: So I think no red flag
8/6/24, 12:10 AM - Aishwarya: But I think you are the type of guy who don't like if your girlfriend has guy friends 

But that is totally valid, especially in today's age 

Some girls are actually just friends with guys though, so some girls won't be able to understand that boundary and label it as toxic 
But your crush don't know about that boundary of yours right?
8/6/24, 12:11 AM - Aishwarya: Also even aromantic people get into relationships 
So I don't think that's her reason 🤔
8/6/24, 12:11 AM - Sayanth: Yeah I'm super possessive but I'll always respect their freedom and rights I'm not gonna control them
8/6/24, 12:11 AM - Aishwarya: Okay 
Yea I actually don't think you have any red flags per say
8/6/24, 12:12 AM - Aishwarya: You look cute( especially for kerala standards)but maybe her type is different
8/6/24, 12:13 AM - Aishwarya: Or maybe she likes guys after spending time with them
8/6/24, 12:14 AM - Aishwarya: Like the irl relationships 

Girls like guys who they see everyday 
Most of the relationship bud in colleges and workplace right
8/6/24, 12:16 AM - Aishwarya: Maybe she has some trauma and is attracted to toxic guys 

But I don't know that works though 
I have read about it 

But most guys are not toxic though, they mostly show normal behaviors only ,except few typical guy behaviors which most guys have 
So that doesn't make sense either
8/6/24, 12:18 AM - Aishwarya: But on the positive side ,she is not leading you on 
Since she said she currently dont like you like that 
That's kinda a green flag from her side
8/6/24, 12:20 AM - Aishwarya: But I'm curious why she doesn't like you 🤔
Atleast why she doesnt want to give it a chance ,since you asked her a few times 

And then who she likes
But I think, that can't be known
8/6/24, 12:21 AM - Sayanth: She doesn't have any trauma
8/6/24, 12:21 AM - Aishwarya: Okay
That's good
8/6/24, 12:22 AM - Sayanth: She never had any crush or relationships
8/6/24, 12:23 AM - Aishwarya: Okay 
It reminds me of the term aromantic 

Like a possibility is there
8/6/24, 12:23 AM - Aishwarya: Does she have many friends?
8/6/24, 12:23 AM - Sayanth: Well i just wanna say you'll always be that beautiful piece of artwork to me. I'll never ever get bored of starring at that precious artwork. It's not just the whole artwork but each and every part of it's precious to me it'll always be like that. I don't want you to feel guilty. Your No hurts so bad but see I fell for this version of you I'm not asking anything more than that just u being u like what u are now that's it. It may work or may not work out  . But for me talking to you. And jamming with you and sharing  music and memes and opening up that's what romance to me. No one makes me feel like u do tho. No one makes me smile like u do. Nothing cures my anxiety or depression like u do. Also dw about ending up hurting me drifting away from you is prolly the worst thing that could happen to Me. I've been scared of everything thinking all those bad what  if scenarios. I don't wanna do that here tho u are so precious to me more than any friend.  Maybe u aren't a constant but my love is
8/6/24, 12:23 AM - Aishwarya: Like is she extroverted?
8/6/24, 12:23 AM - Sayanth: Yeah a lot
8/6/24, 12:23 AM - Sayanth: Yup
8/6/24, 12:23 AM - Sayanth: I just sent this essay to her
8/6/24, 12:26 AM - Aishwarya: Okay so this is not that important ,but I will give a suggestion 
You can consider it next time you like someone 


Not to compliment the looks of the girl so much, if she is confident and pretty 
In the sense, they might take it as the guy liking their looks 
Some girls don't like that
8/6/24, 12:27 AM - Aishwarya: It's like if the girl seems like a girl who is confident in her looks, compliment her personality
8/6/24, 12:27 AM - Sayanth: I wasn't complimenting her looks
8/6/24, 12:27 AM - Aishwarya: If she is kinda insecure, compliment her looks foremost
8/6/24, 12:27 AM - Sayanth: That was about her personality
8/6/24, 12:27 AM - Sayanth: I see but that's kinda manipulation
8/6/24, 12:28 AM - Aishwarya: Yaa I understood 
I was just saying

Like I have read this on dating advice forum for men😬
That what works on women to make them fall for the guy
8/6/24, 12:28 AM - Sayanth: I see
8/6/24, 12:28 AM - Aishwarya: Yaaa 
Kindaaaa
8/6/24, 12:28 AM - Aishwarya: But it's for the good though
8/6/24, 12:29 AM - Aishwarya: Like ethically wrong to do this to a girl, if in the process the girl gets heartbroken 
Otherwise it's not really manipulation 

Example a guy is looking to get laid and the girl is looking for love 
Such cases
8/6/24, 12:30 AM - Aishwarya: Yaa 
Maybe you can consider it for next time
8/6/24, 12:31 AM - Sayanth: I see
8/6/24, 12:31 AM - Sayanth: Well no next time
8/6/24, 12:31 AM - Sayanth: It's either her or imma be Buddhist monk
8/6/24, 12:31 AM - Aishwarya: If this works and you get into relationship 

Don't forget me okay 🥹( coz it's an online friendship )
Like you told that no matter what you will be friends with me too
8/6/24, 12:32 AM - Aishwarya: You gonna find another girl 
If not her
8/6/24, 12:33 AM - Sayanth: Dude I won't forget u unless I get dementia
8/6/24, 12:33 AM - Sayanth: Not prolly
8/6/24, 12:33 AM - Sayanth: I don't find them interesting I can't
8/6/24, 12:34 AM - Aishwarya: Also it's toxic to yourself to hang on to someone who doesn't like you back 

But you can try again though 
Since girls grow to like a guy later on, girls are more complicated in how they like a guy ,comparatively 

So you have a chance 

But even later on if she don't like you ,then don't waste your time 
Move on
8/6/24, 12:34 AM - Aishwarya: Okay 🥹🤭
8/6/24, 12:35 AM - Sayanth: Also I wanted to talk to you have a jam session but I was sooo busy
8/6/24, 12:35 AM - Aishwarya: You will find girl who is interesting to you 

Maybe it will happen when you are not looking for it 
Or otherwise 

But if you look for it ,the odds of finding that interesting girl will be more
8/6/24, 12:35 AM - Aishwarya: That's okayy
8/6/24, 12:38 AM - Aishwarya: That guy who follows 7k girls, he uploaded an anime version romantic status some minutes ago 
Even he is trying to find that girl for him to be in relationship with, even though he don't deserve that girl ( unless she is toxic like him )
8/6/24, 12:39 AM - Aishwarya: You are good person ,who is a one girl guy ,you deserve it 🥹
8/6/24, 12:40 AM - Sayanth: I mean there are Sure shots if I were into just sex I would have been actually lucky. But I just want her love .
8/6/24, 12:40 AM - Aishwarya: Look for it enough and you will find it 

You might find it ,but you have to look for it 

Like you said maybe currently try the chance with that girl
8/6/24, 12:41 AM - Sayanth: Yeah
8/6/24, 12:41 AM - Aishwarya: Yaa 
Finding just sex is more difficult for guys, in general 
Coz many girls are looking for love 


So see you have the odds 
But you have to try to find that girl
8/6/24, 12:42 AM - Aishwarya: Currently that girl 

And if not another girl will be there
8/6/24, 12:42 AM - Aishwarya: You deserve that love 
You gonna find it
8/6/24, 12:43 AM - Sayanth: In my case it's the opposite I've been asked to sext few times even yesterday a friend of mine asked me.
8/6/24, 12:43 AM - Aishwarya: Ohh
8/6/24, 12:43 AM - Aishwarya: Nice 🤭
8/6/24, 12:44 AM - Aishwarya: Is she from irl ?
8/6/24, 12:44 AM - Aishwarya: Or dating app ?
8/6/24, 12:46 AM - Sayanth: The one from yesterday we met on reddit she texted me like idk her much but once I had comforted her I still do sometimes that's all I know
8/6/24, 12:46 AM - Sayanth: Nope irl idk
8/6/24, 12:46 AM - Aishwarya: Oh okay
8/6/24, 12:47 AM - Sayanth: I'm like emotional support assistant 🥲
8/6/24, 12:47 AM - Aishwarya: Comforted her means ,like she went through a breakup 

You don't have to say if you don't want to btw
8/6/24, 12:47 AM - Aishwarya: 😬😂🥹lol
8/6/24, 12:48 AM - Sayanth: Yeah a breakup then rejection, she's a bit alcoholist too
8/6/24, 12:48 AM - Aishwarya: Okay so I can also avail it 🥹

But remember I haven't availed it yet okayy <This message was edited>
8/6/24, 12:48 AM - Aishwarya: Ohh okayy
8/6/24, 12:49 AM - Sayanth: Dude I told u if it's practically possible it'll be done
8/6/24, 12:49 AM - Aishwarya: Okayy
8/6/24, 12:49 AM - Aishwarya: Thanks
8/6/24, 12:50 AM - Aishwarya: That was the first time I saw something special in you 
Like you saying you have been emotional support to few people
8/6/24, 12:50 AM - Aishwarya: And I think one of them stopped talking to you later on
8/6/24, 12:51 AM - Sayanth: <Media omitted>
8/6/24, 12:51 AM - Sayanth: <Media omitted>

8/6/24, 1:14 AM - Aishwarya: Really

Like you said you are people pleaser right 

So they don't usually say no 

So how can I know if you are answering without hesitation

 or being nice because you can't say 'sorry I'm not comfortable with this question ,it's kinda personal '
8/6/24, 1:14 AM - Aishwarya: Hehe 😂
8/6/24, 1:15 AM - Sayanth: Yeah but that's my personality you'll never annoy me
8/6/24, 1:15 AM - Sayanth: I don't lie either
8/6/24, 1:16 AM - Aishwarya: Like people pleaser ?

8/6/24, 1:17 AM - Aishwarya: Okay then 
Thanks 🥹
8/6/24, 1:18 AM - Aishwarya: Let me see how you say no 


Can you give me your Google password please 🥹🥺😭
8/6/24, 1:19 AM - Sayanth: No sorry that's strictly personal I'm not comfortable at all sharing that info
8/6/24, 1:19 AM - Aishwarya: Okay 🥺🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂
8/6/24, 1:19 AM - Aishwarya: 🤭💀
8/6/24, 1:19 AM - Aishwarya: Okay so
8/6/24, 1:19 AM - Aishwarya: I was gonna ask if
8/6/24, 1:19 AM - Sayanth: Sooo
8/6/24, 1:19 AM - Sayanth: Iffff
8/6/24, 1:20 AM - Aishwarya: Jikru has girlfriend 
But I felt like it might be personal coz it's your friends details yk
8/6/24, 1:20 AM - Aishwarya: Like idk I just got curious
8/6/24, 1:21 AM - Sayanth: Yeah he has
8/6/24, 1:21 AM - Aishwarya: Okay
8/6/24, 1:21 AM - Aishwarya: I had a friend who asked stuff out of curiosity 
I don't want to be like that
So thats why I asked in advance
8/6/24, 1:23 AM - Aishwarya: She once asked one of our friends, if she kissed her ex 😭


Like I can understand the curiosity, a bitttt

But I would never ask like that to someone ,especially someone I want to maintain contacts with
8/6/24, 1:23 AM - Sayanth: See if it's something that shouldn't be told I won't but you can ask me anything ok if it's something I can't answer I'll let u know
8/6/24, 1:23 AM - Aishwarya: Okayy
Yaa
8/6/24, 1:23 AM - Sayanth: Yeah relatable
8/6/24, 1:24 AM - Aishwarya: I found it very weird too ,the question 
And clearly she didn't like that question (like ofcourse)

But the information was kinda dopamine hit yk 

It's like people engage in gossip 
Why the big boss etc is so popular
8/6/24, 1:25 AM - Sayanth: Ok I gotta go now gotta wake up early so
8/6/24, 1:25 AM - Aishwarya: But doing this for friendship etc will strain the friendship 

So I'm always very careful 

And I'm double careful irl actually
8/6/24, 1:25 AM - Sayanth: U text I'll reply tomorrow
8/6/24, 1:25 AM - Aishwarya: Okay
8/6/24, 1:26 AM - Sayanth: Goodnight

8/6/24, 9:22 PM - Sayanth: Yeah
8/6/24, 9:22 PM - Aishwarya: Nice

8/6/24, 9:40 PM - Sayanth: Sorry
8/6/24, 9:40 PM - Aishwarya: It's okay
8/6/24, 9:40 PM - Aishwarya: So you won't be free today right
8/6/24, 9:40 PM - Sayanth: No I'm free now
8/6/24, 9:41 PM - Aishwarya: Oh okay
8/6/24, 9:41 PM - Sayanth: It's just I was replying to all those texts
8/6/24, 9:41 PM - Aishwarya: Oh got it
8/6/24, 9:41 PM - Aishwarya: It's not finished right ?
8/6/24, 9:43 PM - Sayanth: <Media omitted>
8/6/24, 9:43 PM - Sayanth: Here she sent me this morning
8/6/24, 9:44 PM - Sayanth: I mean I like her tho
8/6/24, 9:44 PM - Sayanth: Still
8/6/24, 9:44 PM - Aishwarya: Oh :( 
That's kinda unfortunate 
The message vibes 
But atleast she knows clearly as of now
8/6/24, 9:45 PM - Aishwarya: Ya you can continue being friends with her ,if that's okay with you
8/6/24, 9:45 PM - Sayanth: Is there any probability that she might change her mind
8/6/24, 9:45 PM - Sayanth: !
8/6/24, 9:45 PM - Aishwarya: Maybe sometime in future she may like you back 
But you should be okay with that not happening at all
8/6/24, 9:46 PM - Sayanth: Hm yeah
8/6/24, 9:46 PM - Sayanth: Well I don't wanna leave her
8/6/24, 9:46 PM - Sayanth: Imma stay being friends with her
8/6/24, 9:46 PM - Aishwarya: Seeing from the way she said ,no 
But she seems like a green flag ,in a way 
Coz she is making sure that you don't get hurt
8/6/24, 9:46 PM - Aishwarya: Ya that's good 
Good people are gems 
Treasure them
8/6/24, 9:46 PM - Sayanth: 😭
8/6/24, 9:47 PM - Aishwarya: Yaa
8/6/24, 9:48 PM - Aishwarya: Be friends with her for a while 

And then tell her pyaar dosti hai 🥹🤭
And see her reaction 🤭
8/6/24, 9:49 PM - Aishwarya: Like you can try your chances in between
8/6/24, 9:49 PM - Aishwarya: It's a line from a hindi movie 
Pretty famous one 
Even mallus know it
8/6/24, 9:50 PM - Sayanth: What does it mean
8/6/24, 9:50 PM - Sayanth: Idk hindi
8/6/24, 9:50 PM - Sayanth: 🥲
8/6/24, 9:51 PM - Aishwarya: That's okay 
It's famous line 
You can just know this line and try it
8/6/24, 9:51 PM - Aishwarya: Pyaar means love 
It means love is friendship 
It's from an srk movie
8/6/24, 9:52 PM - Aishwarya: I have seen people using it in interviews too
8/6/24, 9:52 PM - Aishwarya: Like this is just one example
8/6/24, 9:53 PM - Aishwarya: You can try such ideas 💡
8/6/24, 9:53 PM - Aishwarya: https://youtube.com/shorts/-VapzIE3_K0?si=hSu-qKnTcuQ-smy2
8/6/24, 9:54 PM - Aishwarya: Hum nahi jane denge means he saying he won't let her go 
🥹
8/6/24, 9:54 PM - Sayanth: pyaar dosti hai
8/6/24, 9:54 PM - Sayanth: like thats it
8/6/24, 9:54 PM - Aishwarya: Yaaa
8/6/24, 9:55 PM - Aishwarya: You can try it after like a week of so much chatting with her
8/6/24, 9:55 PM - Aishwarya: Like became more close friends with her
8/6/24, 9:55 PM - Sayanth: oh
8/6/24, 9:55 PM - Aishwarya: And then say during some conversation pyaar dosti hai
8/6/24, 9:56 PM - Sayanth: w8 brb 2 mins
8/6/24, 9:56 PM - Aishwarya: You have to have an idea of what it means, to play with the idea
8/6/24, 9:56 PM - Aishwarya: Okay
8/6/24, 9:59 PM - Aishwarya: Don't send her this okay 
Because in this he pulls her towards him and says pyar dosti hai 🥹 and he is not letting her go 
( actually that girl likes him too in the video)
But for those who don't know them, it can come across as non consensual ( him pulling her )
8/6/24, 9:59 PM - Aishwarya: https://youtube.com/shorts/2F0mq7-ZJGI?si=ff7feALirngOvmK3
8/6/24, 9:59 PM - Sayanth: yeah ok
8/6/24, 9:59 PM - Sayanth: be my wingman
8/6/24, 10:00 PM - Sayanth: wingwoman
8/6/24, 10:00 PM - Aishwarya: Okay🥹🤭
8/6/24, 10:00 PM - Aishwarya: Just in case , she don't know the reference maybe send her this 

But she will most probably know the reference
8/6/24, 10:01 PM - Aishwarya: But better not to send this link too 
Because in this ,srk is too confident
8/6/24, 10:01 PM - Aishwarya: And your crush might not like that vibe, during the conversation time
8/6/24, 10:01 PM - Sayanth: okiiiii
8/6/24, 10:01 PM - Aishwarya: Like you have to set the vibe
8/6/24, 10:02 PM - Aishwarya: Even the friends series, some of the couples in that started off as friends
8/6/24, 10:02 PM - Aishwarya: But I don't have much idea about the references ,coz I haven't watched it
8/6/24, 10:04 PM - Aishwarya: Like use examples etc ( sneakily ) to convince her 

She seems to be too strict with her not wanting to be anything more than friends
8/6/24, 10:04 PM - Sayanth: well idk anything else about these other than just using some cringy pickup lines and may be actually caring about them
8/6/24, 10:04 PM - Aishwarya: Your pickup lines are not cringy though
8/6/24, 10:06 PM - Aishwarya: Plus even if a guy's pickup lines are cringy ,the girl will find it interesting if she finds him cute or she likes him or something
8/6/24, 10:06 PM - Aishwarya: But don't use overused pickup lines with her
8/6/24, 10:08 PM - Aishwarya: Me personally ,I don't find things cringe unless I don't like that person at all ,in any way 
I don't even have to like the person to find it interesting 
So it depends
8/6/24, 10:09 PM - Aishwarya: So don't be lowkey scared of using pickup lines just coz that other girl didn't like them
8/6/24, 10:10 PM - Sayanth: Okkkki
8/6/24, 10:11 PM - Sayanth: Well she does enjoy those
8/6/24, 10:11 PM - Sayanth: Never said it's cringe
8/6/24, 10:11 PM - Sayanth: Yeah
8/6/24, 10:11 PM - Sayanth: Mine are usually original
8/6/24, 10:11 PM - Aishwarya: https://youtube.com/shorts/88-BVebqIQc?si=eJbeRtyo-Eyv7AN0
8/6/24, 10:12 PM - Aishwarya: Okay
8/6/24, 10:12 PM - Aishwarya: That's good
8/6/24, 10:12 PM - Aishwarya: That's a good sign
8/6/24, 10:13 PM - Aishwarya: At max she might be like this
8/6/24, 10:14 PM - Aishwarya: Or maybe she is like this 

In which case no need to worry at all 
She might be cool with it regardless of she likes you or not
8/6/24, 10:14 PM - Sayanth: Yeah prolly
8/6/24, 10:15 PM - Aishwarya: That other girl ( your first crush) is an anomaly 
No girl overreacts like that 
So don't worry
8/6/24, 10:26 PM - Sayanth: She had trauma I guess
8/6/24, 10:28 PM - Aishwarya: Ya 
Sorry 
I wasn't trying to say negative about her btw 
Just trying to make you feel better ,and that is actually the reality though ( reality that usually girls don't overreact that much)😊
8/6/24, 10:28 PM - Sayanth: Yeah dw
8/6/24, 10:28 PM - Sayanth: I didn't feel like u were saying something bad
8/6/24, 10:29 PM - Aishwarya: Okay 
Ya understood 
Just said
8/6/24, 10:34 PM - Sayanth: Yeah

8/6/24, 10:38 PM - Aishwarya: I think I didn't have any celebrity crush 🤔
8/6/24, 10:38 PM - Sayanth: Never ?
8/6/24, 10:38 PM - Aishwarya: I did like some celebs though 
Like the combination of their mannerisms irl or movies ,plus looks
8/6/24, 10:39 PM - Aishwarya: I remember me liking allu arjun in happy and arya 
But I wouldn't consider it a crush 
And asif ali in rithu movie
8/6/24, 10:40 PM - Sayanth: W8 so like how do u differentiate this from crush
8/6/24, 10:40 PM - Aishwarya: For me crush means I fantasize about them 💀
As if I'm dating them
8/6/24, 10:41 PM - Sayanth: hm
8/6/24, 10:41 PM - Aishwarya: But crush can mean different things to different people though 
That I know
8/6/24, 10:41 PM - Sayanth: then shes not my crush then
8/6/24, 10:41 PM - Sayanth: well i guess my actual crush isn't my crush then
8/6/24, 10:42 PM - Aishwarya: Oh 
You can fantasize about her if it makes you happy though 
Who's stopping you 

Even your celeb crush 
But i know that crush can mean different things
8/6/24, 10:43 PM - Aishwarya: Fantasize doesn't have to be sexual even 

Like romantic ones 
Lot of girls ship themselves with their celeb crushes
8/6/24, 10:44 PM - Sayanth: Hm yeah but it just doesn't happen with me
8/6/24, 10:44 PM - Sayanth: Like I know I love her
8/6/24, 10:45 PM - Aishwarya: https://www.reddit.com/r/fictosexual/s/eiNibTr8qd
8/6/24, 10:45 PM - Sayanth: But it feels so wrong to think like that
8/6/24, 10:45 PM - Aishwarya: Yaa this also I have heard 

It is valid 

Coz we don't know if that other person consent to it right 
Especially celebs etc
8/6/24, 10:46 PM - Sayanth: I was talking about my irl crush
8/6/24, 10:46 PM - Sayanth: But that too
8/6/24, 10:46 PM - Aishwarya: Anyways mine is consented 🤭
8/6/24, 10:46 PM - Aishwarya: I have asked him for a relationship chance and he had accepted 🤭
8/6/24, 10:47 PM - Aishwarya: Ya understood
8/6/24, 10:47 PM - Aishwarya: Ya
8/6/24, 10:47 PM - Sayanth: Like it's just my mind wired that way I can't u know sexualize like that it just wouldn't happen even if I tried
8/6/24, 10:47 PM - Sayanth: Like even someone showed me a naked picture of my crush it'd not be a turn on for me
8/6/24, 10:48 PM - Sayanth: Whaaaa
8/6/24, 10:48 PM - Sayanth: When did that happen
8/6/24, 10:48 PM - Aishwarya: I'm like only into consented stuff, even in my delulu 
Probably because the thought of a guy accusing me of sexually harassing him really turns me off (naturally not even coz of the ethics)

Plus I'm only into guys who are into me
8/6/24, 10:49 PM - Aishwarya: Oh okay 
I understand
8/6/24, 10:49 PM - Aishwarya: Oh okay
8/6/24, 10:50 PM - Aishwarya: On the second day of meeting him
8/6/24, 10:50 PM - Aishwarya: But like, he is an easy guy 
So it doesn't really count as an achievement or anything though
8/6/24, 10:51 PM - Sayanth: Wait when did all this happen
8/6/24, 10:51 PM - Sayanth: When did u meet him
8/6/24, 10:51 PM - Sayanth: How
8/6/24, 10:51 PM - Sayanth: Where
8/6/24, 10:51 PM - Aishwarya: I met him on April last year
8/6/24, 10:51 PM - Sayanth: I need the entire story
8/6/24, 10:51 PM - Aishwarya: On reddit
8/6/24, 10:52 PM - Aishwarya: And then I asked for my chance and he accepted
8/6/24, 10:53 PM - Aishwarya: I didn't directly ask for the chance 
But I told him I wish I have a chance with him and that I have a crush on him and that i like him
8/6/24, 10:53 PM - Sayanth: So like what's ur relationship status now?
8/6/24, 10:53 PM - Aishwarya: And then he thought I'm actually looking for a relationship 
Then I said no ( coz I can't date now )
Just that I just wished I had a chance etc
8/6/24, 10:54 PM - Aishwarya: I'm single
8/6/24, 10:55 PM - Aishwarya: And then in August he got into a relationship with some girl 
And he broke up in February this year
8/6/24, 11:00 PM - Aishwarya: I have talked to him only total three days 💀
But I have thought about him everyday
8/6/24, 11:01 PM - Aishwarya: The main positive is that ,he is the reason I got over my college crush
8/6/24, 11:15 PM - Sayanth: It's like u wish u could eat  biriani but shouldn't cuz u are on diet
8/6/24, 11:15 PM - Sayanth: ?
8/6/24, 11:16 PM - Aishwarya: Yaa 
But also he is not biriyani💀

I feel like the dating that I imagined with him will not be what it's like in reality 
And the sex also 😭🥺💀
8/6/24, 11:17 PM - Sayanth: Yeah I mean expectations usually doesn't match reality
8/6/24, 11:17 PM - Sayanth: Glad
8/6/24, 11:17 PM - Sayanth: I should find someone like that I guess
8/6/24, 11:19 PM - Aishwarya: Plus the heartbreak is a guarantee 

My previous crush was cuter than him ,but I don't like him anymore though 

And my previous crush also liked many girls ,much more than how much liked me 
But my previous crush is the kind of guy to atleast consider myself feelings ( like me telling him that him sighting other girls is making me insecure and sad and then he will try to not do it when I'm around and also reduce it)

But this guy is less caring of his girlfriends feelings
8/6/24, 11:19 PM - Aishwarya: Yea 🥺
8/6/24, 11:21 PM - Aishwarya: Its like I want him to be excited to have sex with me 
And to cuddle with me etc 
That kind of expectation I meant

But I feel like that won't be the case ,especially after some time 

I think that's the reason he is serial dater
His relationships have been too short
8/6/24, 11:22 PM - Aishwarya: Yaa 
For me it makes my life kinda interesting ,a bit more 
Having a crush
8/6/24, 11:24 PM - Aishwarya: That was the main reason I didn't take the chance to date my previous crush in college 🥺
Plus that time I wanted to stay virgin till marriage ,but that was a secondary reason
8/6/24, 11:26 PM - Aishwarya: The sex part ,I feel my present crush will like the sex with me more ,than my previous crush 
Which is very important to me 
Even though the previous crush was cuter and more nice person
8/6/24, 11:28 PM - Aishwarya: Both of them are very sexual 
But my present crush's sexual type is more diverse 

But he also is most attracted to the same girls that most guys like though
8/7/24, 12:01 AM - Sayanth: I see
8/7/24, 12:02 AM - Aishwarya: Ya
8/7/24, 12:02 AM - Sayanth: Enikk college il crush indarne povan oru motivation indayene
8/7/24, 12:03 AM - Aishwarya: Oh 
Ya kinda understandable 
But it's a double edged sword for people with social anxiety
8/7/24, 12:05 AM - Aishwarya: https://www.instagram.com/reel/C946MAtqicC/?igsh=MXJxeHJmcW01OG5j
8/7/24, 12:06 AM - Aishwarya: Most of my crushes were guys who I used to see often 
Mostly classmates 😭💀
8/7/24, 12:06 AM - Sayanth: Aa so talk cheymbo cherthayit shaking okke indavm
8/7/24, 12:07 AM - Aishwarya: Nobody gave me any dating advice and back then these internet dating advice were not that much out there 
So I didn't know
8/7/24, 12:07 AM - Aishwarya: Mostly I can't concentrate when I feel like someone is looking ( whether they are actually looking or notv)
8/7/24, 12:08 AM - Sayanth: Yeah but in my case it's just the professors
8/7/24, 12:09 AM - Aishwarya: Ohh 
I'm comfortable around everyone of opposite gender
8/7/24, 12:10 AM - Aishwarya: But near men I get social anxiety
I have it, even if I'm not attracted to that guy
8/7/24, 12:10 AM - Aishwarya: And it's more if the guy is not bad looking
8/7/24, 12:11 AM - Aishwarya: Otherwise it's very less ,negligible
8/7/24, 12:12 AM - Aishwarya: Bad looking in the sense ,less than below average 
I don't like saying it like that 
But to get the idea
8/7/24, 12:13 AM - Aishwarya: In the sense ,I kind of know I won't like them in any case 
At no point
8/7/24, 12:14 AM - Aishwarya: But I did kinda like one such guy 
Because he liked me 
So it depends 

In such cases little bit social anxiety I would have
8/7/24, 12:14 AM - Aishwarya: Most social anxiety is when I'm trying to hide that I like some guy 😭
8/7/24, 12:14 AM - Aishwarya: I might not like that guy 

But I have some fear that he will misunderstand me
8/7/24, 12:15 AM - Aishwarya: I get little shy and smile sometimes ,when I'm around people 
Especially men
8/7/24, 12:17 AM - Aishwarya: Around bad looking guys, I'm afraid that they will misunderstand that I like them and then sexually harass me or something
8/7/24, 12:18 AM - Aishwarya: Around not so bad looking guys ,it's mainly I don't want them to misunderstand that I like them because I feel bit ashamed ( because they can get better girls and then will pity me for liking them, the possibility )
8/7/24, 12:20 AM - Aishwarya: And I then I consciously try to hide that shyness by putting on attitude face 💀

Sometimes the shyness won't be there ,I'm just afraid if my face is looking shy
8/7/24, 12:21 AM - Aishwarya: Especially when I'm traveling in train it's too much 💀
Like when I sometimes look at the face of the guy sitting opposite me ,idk some smile comes to my face 
For no reason
8/7/24, 12:22 AM - Aishwarya: It's like when we go to a dead person's house and we want to act serious but somewhere we get smile 😭

I'm very conscious of my facial expressions 💀
8/7/24, 12:26 AM - Aishwarya: Like the smile don't come 
Coz I'm consciously putting on attitude 😭
It's like I can't be my natural self 
One of the resson why I get tired when I travel
8/7/24, 12:26 AM - Sayanth: Trauma
8/7/24, 12:30 AM - Aishwarya: I don't have any trauma coz of outside men and sexual harassment 
In fact ,like few men have touched and it didn't register as trauma 
Other than me getting annoyed and angry for few minutes and later I forgot about it 

Mainly I'm afraid that they will sexually harass me and then blame me for it, coz I was smiling 
And I will blame myself 
So brain trying to protect itself
8/7/24, 12:31 AM - Sayanth: Oh
8/7/24, 12:32 AM - Aishwarya: I think it was not trauma because I have heard that touching in bus etc happens to most women atleast once in their life 
So the brain probably normalized it
8/7/24, 12:33 AM - Sayanth: Happens to everyone but for us it's pretty normal but for women I guess it may feel as inappropriate
8/7/24, 12:33 AM - Sayanth: Happens to me always
8/7/24, 12:33 AM - Aishwarya: But I try to avoid traveling by bus if I can, coz of such men
8/7/24, 12:33 AM - Sayanth: And I hate it
8/7/24, 12:33 AM - Sayanth: Oh
8/7/24, 12:36 AM - Aishwarya: Ya it feels inappropriate and disrespectful 

I remember few months ago in a bus ,four men got inside from front door and the women didn't say anything even though the bus was crowded 

I didn't say anything coz its the standing womens responsibility to guard themselves 
I thought I was safe because I was sitting 
But one guy tried to gring against me 
I looked at him in a wtf kind of way and then he went away
8/7/24, 12:36 AM - Aishwarya: That's sad :(
8/7/24, 12:36 AM - Aishwarya: Ya :(
8/7/24, 12:36 AM - Aishwarya: Okay I have a doubt 
Just curious
8/7/24, 12:37 AM - Aishwarya: Have any women did this ?
Like grinding in bus etc 
Like any inappropriate stuff 
To you ?
8/7/24, 12:37 AM - Aishwarya: I have heard that the ones who do inappropriate stuff to men are mostly other men
8/7/24, 12:38 AM - Aishwarya: Probably gay men
8/7/24, 12:39 AM - Aishwarya: I think it's because women's and men's sexuality is different
8/7/24, 12:39 AM - Aishwarya: But there are some exceptions
8/7/24, 12:42 AM - Aishwarya: Something happened when I was in school 
Not anything major
8/7/24, 12:43 AM - Aishwarya: I was having an exam that day and I was traveling in private bus 

I can't remember the guy ,but I think he looked kinda nice 
So it didn't register to me as him doing anything bad 💀
8/7/24, 12:45 AM - Aishwarya: But I was focused on my exam 
I was standing in bus and I had some papers in my hand 
I was revising that
8/7/24, 12:45 AM - Aishwarya: I only realized after many years when I got to college
Before I didn't have much idea about all this
8/7/24, 12:46 AM - Aishwarya: I think I was in 8 th standard during the time
8/7/24, 12:48 AM - Sayanth: Always but idk if they are doing it intentionally
8/7/24, 12:48 AM - Aishwarya: Something happened when I was in 4 th 💀
Like a guy in a sub road nearby our home 
He was showing milk 💀😭
Like I thought so 💀
He was like wanna see milk coming from there 

My brother saved me from there ,he told let's go away from this guy
8/7/24, 12:48 AM - Sayanth: 🫂
8/7/24, 12:49 AM - Sayanth: Sorry u had to  go through that
8/7/24, 12:49 AM - Aishwarya: But idk it was funny 💀

Idk probably because I had no idea , it didn't register as trauma
8/7/24, 12:49 AM - Aishwarya: Thanks for being an understanding and empathetic person
8/7/24, 12:51 AM - Aishwarya: I can't remember if I saw the organ ( I think I didn't see ,but idk if it was visible though)
Probably coz I was trying to see milk 💀
8/7/24, 12:51 AM - Aishwarya: But now since I'm aware it would be trauma
8/7/24, 12:52 AM - Aishwarya: I didn't even know anything related to sexual stuff 
Or sexual violations 
Probably that's why it didn't register as trauma
8/7/24, 12:53 AM - Aishwarya: Ohh 
Okay 
I want to ask more 
But only if you are comfortable 

Related to who they are ( not name ofcourse)
Like age ,how they look like, if the are by themselves or traveling with someone else etc
8/7/24, 12:54 AM - Aishwarya: Rn I'm going to sleep 
Coz I have to wake up bit early to go somewhere tomorrow
8/7/24, 12:55 AM - Aishwarya: I don't mind sharing about such incidents 

But for some people it can be uncomfortable 
So feel free to say if you don't want to say
8/7/24, 12:59 AM - Aishwarya: But I think since you don't know if it's intentionally or not 

So it's not useful data 
Like I wanted to know about if such women exists too ,or if it's rare
8/7/24, 12:59 AM - Aishwarya: Soo no need to say
8/7/24, 12:59 AM - Aishwarya: Okay bye
8/7/24, 12:59 AM - Aishwarya: Going to sleep
8/7/24, 12:59 AM - Aishwarya: Good night
8/7/24, 12:59 AM - Aishwarya: Take care
8/7/24, 10:05 PM - Aishwarya: Hey

Why she did like that ?👀
8/7/24, 10:27 PM - Sayanth: <Media omitted>
8/7/24, 10:27 PM - Sayanth: A mutual friend of ours said this
8/7/24, 10:28 PM - Aishwarya: Oh okay
8/7/24, 10:28 PM - Aishwarya: She has a boyfriend 
And he doesn't like her talking to other guys 

Did I understand correctly?
8/7/24, 10:28 PM - Aishwarya: And he don't like her talking to you
8/7/24, 10:28 PM - Sayanth: Yeah
8/7/24, 10:29 PM - Sayanth: Prolly I guess
8/7/24, 10:29 PM - Aishwarya: Does she secretly like you ?

Is there some angle like that in the story ?
8/7/24, 10:29 PM - Sayanth: But the thing is I wasn't even trying to flirt
8/7/24, 10:29 PM - Sayanth: Not even remotely
8/7/24, 10:29 PM - Aishwarya: Okay
8/7/24, 10:29 PM - Aishwarya: Ya

Since her boyfriend is too controlling

8/7/24, 10:46 PM - Aishwarya: Oh nice 🥹

Yess
8/7/24, 10:47 PM - Aishwarya: The duality of Sai😎
8/7/24, 10:49 PM - Aishwarya: I mean you are 🥹
But also ⚔️
8/7/24, 10:52 PM - Aishwarya: But the best is to run away 
Knowing that the bully etc can be ⚔️🩸⚰️ but choosing not to 

Coz safety first 
And coz nobody wins in fights ,mostly
8/7/24, 10:54 PM - Sayanth: Yeah
8/7/24, 10:55 PM - Sayanth: I would never start a fight I'd never land the first hit
8/7/24, 10:55 PM - Aishwarya: That's good
8/7/24, 10:55 PM - Aishwarya: The best way to be
8/7/24, 10:55 PM - Sayanth: But but🥲
8/7/24, 10:55 PM - Aishwarya: Ya
8/7/24, 10:55 PM - Sayanth: I've this very very short temper
8/7/24, 10:55 PM - Aishwarya: Oh explain plz
8/7/24, 10:56 PM - Aishwarya: When does that happen?
8/7/24, 10:56 PM - Aishwarya: Last when it happened?
8/7/24, 10:56 PM - Sayanth: So if someone's annoying me I'll get so frustrated I might lose control
8/7/24, 10:56 PM - Sayanth: I nearly tried to choke mom
8/7/24, 10:56 PM - Sayanth: Like I didn't
8/7/24, 10:56 PM - Aishwarya: Okay
8/7/24, 10:57 PM - Sayanth: But my hands were literally aiming for her throat
8/7/24, 10:57 PM - Aishwarya: Ohh ,what did she do to provoke you that much ?
8/7/24, 10:57 PM - Aishwarya: Ohh
8/7/24, 10:57 PM - Sayanth: I was talking to her about my anxiety
8/7/24, 10:57 PM - Aishwarya: Okay
8/7/24, 10:57 PM - Sayanth: And she was making jokes out of it
8/7/24, 10:57 PM - Aishwarya: Ohh wth
8/7/24, 10:58 PM - Sayanth: Yeah
8/7/24, 10:58 PM - Aishwarya: For example 
What did she say ?
8/7/24, 10:58 PM - Aishwarya: The most triggering one
8/7/24, 10:58 PM - Aishwarya: Like
8/7/24, 10:58 PM - Aishwarya: Should respect parents
8/7/24, 10:58 PM - Aishwarya: But exceptions are thereeee
8/7/24, 10:59 PM - Aishwarya: So it dependssss
8/7/24, 10:59 PM - Sayanth: Again I didn't I can control it but still I'm not exactly that cool I'm more like either cool or just angry no in between . If u are gonna do something bad to me I'd either forgive and forget that or just start to hate you to the core like that
8/7/24, 11:00 PM - Aishwarya: Also for people with severe anxiety it can be very sensitive topic 

So making jokes on it is triggering 
So I understand
8/7/24, 11:00 PM - Sayanth: It wasn't just a single statement and tbh I don't really remember
8/7/24, 11:00 PM - Aishwarya: It's like hitting on the weakest and sensitive points of a person 

What is sensitive topic of each person differs
8/7/24, 11:00 PM - Sayanth: But she wasn't even listening to me and said I'm a psycho and all
8/7/24, 11:01 PM - Aishwarya: Okay
8/7/24, 11:01 PM - Sayanth: Yeah I can control it to some extent if it's verbal yeah I can but if it's physically annoying then it's something I can't tolerate much
8/7/24, 11:01 PM - Aishwarya: Okay 

Everyone has a dark side 
Being triggered to the max can bring it out 
Can or might ,the potential is there
8/7/24, 11:02 PM - Aishwarya: Okay 
Ya
8/7/24, 11:02 PM - Sayanth: Like if someone slaps me without any reasons I'll prolly try to murder that person
8/7/24, 11:02 PM - Sayanth: I'd get sooo angry within seconds
8/7/24, 11:03 PM - Aishwarya: Oh
8/7/24, 11:03 PM - Aishwarya: I see 
I'm not understanding the depth of it 

But yea when people get reallyy angry, they can lose it
8/7/24, 11:04 PM - Aishwarya: Depth in the sense 
I don't know what kind of stuffs anger you

I'm guessing it's mainly the usual annoying things right? <This message was edited>
8/7/24, 11:05 PM - Aishwarya: Like that bully right ?
8/7/24, 11:07 PM - Aishwarya: Okay so 

What if a friend pulls your cheek in a loving playful way ( not in a painful way ofcourse)
( like how people pull babies cheeks yk )

( like he or she didn't know that you don't like it )


Like they did it for the first time 

How would you react ?
8/7/24, 11:07 PM - Aishwarya: I'm curious 🤔
8/7/24, 11:15 PM - Sayanth: Yeah
8/7/24, 11:15 PM - Sayanth: Like people not respecting someone else's freedom
8/7/24, 11:15 PM - Sayanth: Or boundaries
8/7/24, 11:15 PM - Aishwarya: Okay
8/7/24, 11:15 PM - Aishwarya: Ya that's understandable
8/7/24, 11:15 PM - Sayanth: Well that's totally ok
8/7/24, 11:16 PM - Sayanth: I'd be glad they did
8/7/24, 11:16 PM - Sayanth: It
8/7/24, 11:16 PM - Aishwarya: Okay then
8/7/24, 11:16 PM - Aishwarya: I see 🥹

Noted
8/7/24, 11:17 PM - Sayanth: Relatable
8/7/24, 11:17 PM - Aishwarya: Oh 
Okay
8/7/24, 11:17 PM - Sayanth: Don't do that tho just express what u feel like at the moment
8/7/24, 11:17 PM - Aishwarya: Okay 
Ya
8/7/24, 11:19 PM - Sayanth: I don't think men ever done something like that to me. But well I'd not notice cuz u know it's another man I'd not suspect any ill intentions . Like if a girl is doing that to another girl they wouldn't prolly suspect either I guess like that
8/7/24, 11:20 PM - Sayanth: But yeah that's true
8/7/24, 11:23 PM - Aishwarya: Like I had come across some data 
And it showed that guys who were sexually abused etc ,most of the cases happened when they were a teenager or when they were a child ( probably because they are less aware and not physically strong to defend themselves, so the sexual abuse perpetuator men take advantage of that 

And the perpetuators ( if it's a male ,which is most cases ) are old men 
Or like much older guys 
Usually gay guys
8/7/24, 11:24 PM - Aishwarya: Yess
8/7/24, 11:24 PM - Aishwarya: I know a guy who has ,kind of a pretty boy look
8/7/24, 11:25 PM - Aishwarya: But he is not thatt pretty though
8/7/24, 11:26 PM - Aishwarya: Like he had told that once when he came out of a shower wearing a towel ,his roommate told him that dude you look hot
8/7/24, 11:27 PM - Aishwarya: Plus he has gotten compliments from gay guys many times 
He told that it had increased his confidence
8/7/24, 11:27 PM - Aishwarya: And he declined them politely saying he is straight
8/7/24, 11:28 PM - Sayanth: Yeah
8/7/24, 11:29 PM - Aishwarya: But sometimes when gay guys compliments in ways crossing the boundaries ( I have heard that some gay guys are very horny ) ,the straight guys who is on the receptive end of that compliment can get uncomfortable 
Which is valid
8/7/24, 11:30 PM - Aishwarya: He has faced inappropriate sexual behavior from gay men thrice or so 
Once was in a bus ,that was an old man
8/7/24, 11:30 PM - Sayanth: Oh it's usually the crowded buses
8/7/24, 11:31 PM - Aishwarya: Oh okay
8/7/24, 11:31 PM - Sayanth: And usually I'd be standing in the middle part of the bus
8/7/24, 11:31 PM - Sayanth: Like between females and males
8/7/24, 11:32 PM - Aishwarya: Okay
8/7/24, 11:57 PM - Sayanth: And those women usually don't care if they touch us or not
8/7/24, 11:57 PM - Sayanth: Like not intentionally
8/7/24, 11:57 PM - Sayanth: But it's still uncomfortable
8/7/24, 11:57 PM - Sayanth: Btw
8/7/24, 11:58 PM - Sayanth: I gotta wake up early
8/7/24, 11:58 PM - Sayanth: So bye
8/7/24, 11:58 PM - Sayanth: Goodnight

8/11/24, 10:26 PM - Aishwarya: Okay

8/11/24, 10:27 PM - Aishwarya: And cute
8/11/24, 10:27 PM - Aishwarya: Don't stress much 😊
8/11/24, 10:28 PM - Sayanth: Not at all
8/11/24, 10:29 PM - Sayanth: I don't think I'm cute at all
8/11/24, 10:29 PM - Aishwarya: In the sense ,you told that you used to be topper right 
And you are interested in tech kinda
8/11/24, 10:29 PM - Aishwarya: You are
8/11/24, 10:30 PM - Sayanth: Yeah
8/11/24, 10:30 PM - Aishwarya: At first when you gave your instagram etc directly I was like oh he knows he kinda cute
8/11/24, 10:30 PM - Sayanth: I'm not cute 🥲
8/11/24, 10:30 PM - Sayanth: I just didn't care about my looks
8/11/24, 10:30 PM - Aishwarya: Thats what's I thought at first
8/11/24, 10:32 PM - Aishwarya: And I was like I can't flirt with this guy at all 💀 like just simply people flirt right, for fun
Coz cute 🙂

Like apart from the age thing
8/11/24, 10:32 PM - Aishwarya: I see 🤔
8/11/24, 10:32 PM - Aishwarya: You probably have insecurities in looks too 
Coz most people are not perfect
8/11/24, 10:33 PM - Aishwarya: Yea like you said, you have
8/11/24, 10:33 PM - Aishwarya: But face card is kinda there 
Plus fair 😊
8/11/24, 10:33 PM - Aishwarya: So don't stress 😊
8/11/24, 10:33 PM - Aishwarya: You gonna be alright
8/11/24, 10:35 PM - Aishwarya: And i was like why is he giving his cv to some stranger 🤭
I didn't think you are insecure etc
8/11/24, 10:36 PM - Aishwarya: Like everyone has insecurities ofcourse
8/11/24, 10:37 PM - Aishwarya: I think it's probably coz your mom said your marks were not enough even though you used to be topper 
Like such things can effect confidence
8/11/24, 10:38 PM - Sayanth: Yeah
8/11/24, 10:38 PM - Aishwarya: Idk if you were perfect in looks ,girls will flock to you and you won't have time to remain single
8/11/24, 10:39 PM - Aishwarya: Apol pinne how would I have gotten a friend like you 

Full buzy aayirikille? 😭🤭
8/11/24, 10:39 PM - Sayanth: It's not good looking tho
8/11/24, 10:40 PM - Sayanth: That true
8/11/24, 10:40 PM - Aishwarya: Hmm angane choichal 
There is levels right 
But you are definitely cute
8/11/24, 10:40 PM - Aishwarya: Ya🙂🤭
8/11/24, 10:42 PM - Aishwarya: But direct correlation not much though 
Coz I told about one guy friend right ,he is cute 
But he broke up last year
8/11/24, 10:42 PM - Sayanth: U are just being polite
8/11/24, 10:42 PM - Aishwarya: He could be in relationship now 
But he is single
8/11/24, 10:42 PM - Sayanth: Oh sad
8/11/24, 10:43 PM - Aishwarya: No ,he is not interested to be in relationship now 

From what he said, he is dating to marry kind of guy
8/11/24, 10:44 PM - Aishwarya: Allaa

You itself have told that you are cute 😬
8/11/24, 10:46 PM - Aishwarya: But these kind of guys are rare probably 

And I think he is an anomaly 
Coz his interest is in other stuff
8/11/24, 10:47 PM - Sayanth: I'm not just some people tell me I'm cute
8/11/24, 10:47 PM - Sayanth: But then again ik I'm ugly
8/11/24, 10:48 PM - Aishwarya: Nooo
8/11/24, 10:49 PM - Sayanth: Tbh I don't think I'm pretty
8/11/24, 10:49 PM - Aishwarya: Nice 

Usually in irl, girls don't compliment guys coz they will think they are interested in them ( they may or might not be interested)
But it's a bad reputation for the girl 


And guys don't compliment guys usually coz they think it's gay
8/11/24, 10:50 PM - Aishwarya: I would probably not say you are cute if I have to see you irl often 
Does that make sense 

So there is that factor yk
8/11/24, 10:52 PM - Aishwarya: Yet still some people called you cute right 
So it counts
8/11/24, 10:52 PM - Aishwarya: Like irl
8/11/24, 10:52 PM - Sayanth: Yeah
8/11/24, 10:55 PM - Aishwarya: Pinne
8/11/24, 10:55 PM - Aishwarya: You said you want love type relationship right
8/11/24, 10:55 PM - Aishwarya: And usually in relationship the girl kinda looks better than the guy 
Or same
8/11/24, 10:56 PM - Aishwarya: So you are safe yk
8/11/24, 10:56 PM - Aishwarya: Only in dating area looks count right
8/11/24, 10:57 PM - Aishwarya: So safe aanu yk
8/11/24, 11:06 PM - Aishwarya: Maybe famous allatha kind of chai lenin , you might have chance yk🥹
8/11/24, 11:06 PM - Aishwarya: She's pretty
8/11/24, 11:07 PM - Aishwarya: But not like prettiest in the world kinda girl
8/11/24, 11:07 PM - Aishwarya: So you definitely have a chance
8/11/24, 11:07 PM - Aishwarya: Don't worry
8/11/24, 11:08 PM - Sayanth: Tbh I think she's soooo pretty
8/11/24, 11:08 PM - Aishwarya: Yea she is conventionally pretty
8/11/24, 11:09 PM - Aishwarya: But prettiest alla enna udheshiche in insta world
8/11/24, 11:09 PM - Aishwarya: So you might have a chance
8/11/24, 11:09 PM - Aishwarya: If she was not famous
8/11/24, 11:09 PM - Sayanth: Chai lenin

8/14/24, 10:20 PM - Aishwarya: Pinne you are one of my few friends I actually care about 

I don't want one less number in that 😭🥺
8/14/24, 10:20 PM - Sayanth: Oh text me now
8/14/24, 10:21 PM - Sayanth: I'll get back in 5 mins
8/14/24, 10:21 PM - Aishwarya: Oh, okay then
8/14/24, 10:21 PM - Aishwarya: Okay
8/14/24, 10:21 PM - Sayanth: Well prolly I guess
8/14/24, 10:21 PM - Aishwarya: Ya
8/14/24, 10:22 PM - Aishwarya: My crush uploaded a song he sang on his instagram 
Previous week he went for a concert, and I didn't open the instagram story of that ( I usually open it ,when he posts something, to see more pics etc lol )
8/14/24, 10:22 PM - Aishwarya: Otherwise he just posts many memes and stuff
8/14/24, 10:24 PM - Aishwarya: So yesterday I opened the instagram story 
And like he had posted some good stuff ( virtue signaling to attract girls I guess or he just simply posted that )
8/14/24, 10:24 PM - Aishwarya: And I was bit happy that he is kind of good 
Not even bare minimum though
8/14/24, 10:25 PM - Sayanth: Oh and
8/14/24, 10:25 PM - Aishwarya: One girl had commented bravo bro on his comments 
I previously thought its some girl he talking to
8/14/24, 10:26 PM - Sayanth: I see
8/14/24, 10:26 PM - Sayanth: And
8/14/24, 10:26 PM - Sayanth: ?
8/14/24, 10:26 PM - Aishwarya: And he posted the same song video on YouTube also 
There was a comment in that around 12 night yesterday 
Asking 'how are you single '
The comment was made by some guy ( his friend I think)
8/14/24, 10:28 PM - Aishwarya: Like what's the point of that comment 
Probably so that people who see it will think he is single ( he is not in relationship but that doesn't mean single single though ,he is wanna be hoe even though he is fat )
8/14/24, 10:28 PM - Aishwarya: And then he replied to that youtube comment  ,i wouldn't be single if I knew why
8/14/24, 10:29 PM - Sayanth: Oh
8/14/24, 10:29 PM - Aishwarya: Wth ,he is single coz he is commitment phobic even at this age
8/14/24, 10:30 PM - Aishwarya: He broke up with previous girl, one reason being he didn't get enough time for his video games coz she wanted to talk on call for long time
8/14/24, 10:30 PM - Aishwarya: One reason
8/14/24, 10:30 PM - Sayanth: Hm may I say something
8/14/24, 10:32 PM - Aishwarya: Which is okay 
His life his choices 

But he is not cute enough to just fuck around 
One reason being at his age ,most other women are looking to get married 

And the girls who are 25 less they are also looking to get married 
And the other girls who 25 below who are in the hookup phase in bangalore, they are not looking for that with him 
Most probably
8/14/24, 10:32 PM - Aishwarya: Yaaa
8/14/24, 10:34 PM - Aishwarya: And today in instagram comment ,a girl commented 
' call my name'

And he replied 😂ok
8/14/24, 10:34 PM - Aishwarya: Her comment is bit related to the lyric of the song
8/14/24, 10:34 PM - Sayanth: Oh
8/14/24, 10:34 PM - Aishwarya: What is that ?
8/14/24, 10:35 PM - Aishwarya: Like I just wanted to vent about it 
It doesn't really matter 
I don't really care
8/14/24, 10:35 PM - Aishwarya: This happened an hour ago
8/14/24, 10:36 PM - Aishwarya: Rn I'm like not really sad 
Mostly atleast
8/14/24, 10:36 PM - Aishwarya: I just wanted to say about it to get it off my mind
8/14/24, 10:36 PM - Sayanth: May be you are over estimating him
8/14/24, 10:37 PM - Aishwarya: My pune friend will get annoyed if I tell about him to her 
Coz she already told some stuff about him and told to let him go fully
8/14/24, 10:38 PM - Aishwarya: Means 

I mean he don't get casual dates 
But he can get a girl for serious relationship coz he has a good career
8/14/24, 10:38 PM - Sayanth: Yeah ok got it
8/14/24, 10:38 PM - Aishwarya: Okay
8/14/24, 10:39 PM - Sayanth: You should let him go tho
8/14/24, 10:39 PM - Aishwarya: It's not a crush 
I feel less alone in some things because of him 

It's like everyone I know want kids 
Things like that 

Plus he is someone I look upto ,career wise etc
8/14/24, 10:39 PM - Sayanth: But yeah if u think having crush on him is making u feel better it's ok
8/14/24, 10:40 PM - Sayanth: Ik ik
8/14/24, 10:40 PM - Aishwarya: Yaa I don't really have crush type of feelings much now 

Even though a bit It's there 
But it's mostly good 

I just wanted to talk about it 
Coz it helps to clear mind
8/14/24, 10:40 PM - Aishwarya: Yaa it is 
Mostly
8/14/24, 10:41 PM - Aishwarya: Plus the crush has faded 
Mostly 
Mainly it's an inspiration vibe etc
8/14/24, 10:42 PM - Aishwarya: And my main dream is go from this country 
So there is no future with him anyways 
So coz of that also I'm not really attached to him or anything
8/14/24, 10:43 PM - Aishwarya: Even when he got into relationship last year ,I didn't really feel anything
8/14/24, 10:45 PM - Aishwarya: But when I found out about one other girl 
I did feel jealous and I had cried for sometime 
And then I forgot about it 
But that's mostly related to me feeling not good enough sexually( compared to another girl ) 
But that feeling will arise regardless if I have a crush or not
8/14/24, 10:46 PM - Sayanth: I see
8/14/24, 10:47 PM - Aishwarya: In fact my previous crush had kind of sexually rejected me fully 
Even though he is a sexual person 
But that could be any other guy too 

When I got this crush is how I healed some of the trauma from it
8/14/24, 10:47 PM - Aishwarya: So overall I'm kinda grateful to him
8/14/24, 10:49 PM - Sayanth: Well don't compare yourself with anyone else tho
8/14/24, 10:50 PM - Sayanth: It's not like u look bad or anything
8/14/24, 10:50 PM - Aishwarya: Ya true
8/14/24, 10:50 PM - Aishwarya: Ya true
8/14/24, 10:51 PM - Aishwarya: Today I felt that he was kind of lying or something 
To increase his chances of fucking around 
Idk
8/14/24, 10:51 PM - Sayanth: What did he say if I may ask
8/14/24, 10:51 PM - Sayanth: Oh why
8/14/24, 10:52 PM - Aishwarya: The deceiving part is why I felt kinda annoyed 
Mostly 

And not even related to him 

It made me feel like world is so evil etc 
Like everyone so selfish 

Then I had to think myself into that's not true
8/14/24, 10:53 PM - Aishwarya: And I got reminded of my two female friends who were close 
And what they did 

And I got lowkey annoyed and angry at them too 😭💀

For a while
8/14/24, 10:55 PM - Aishwarya: Actually he didn't say anything 💀

I just felt so 
But it's probably true though ( from some of my observations)

Doesn't matter coz I don't have crush on him anymore
8/14/24, 10:56 PM - Aishwarya: But he was very respectful 

He has never commented anything about anyone's looks badly, like body shaming stuff 

But people are attracted to what they are attracted to
8/14/24, 10:57 PM - Aishwarya: From some signs I felt so 

And he is someone who is into lot of hookups ,but he doesn't get them ,coz no looks much 

It doesn't matter ,I just got annoyed at the moment
8/14/24, 10:59 PM - Aishwarya: But my close friend in college ,she told something during a conversation ( I was  talking about my crush plus some other stuff ,with her )

She told that guys will fuck a kolam kept in farm 
( like a quote in malayalam)
8/14/24, 11:01 PM - Aishwarya: Why did she say like that 😭
My mind took it as an attack towards me 

But like during that evening itself ,at the same table , she told that I have some nice features etc ,don't worry 🥺
So she did care about my mental health
8/14/24, 11:04 PM - Aishwarya: And some other day when I was talking about my skin colour insecurity ,and that many guys my skin tone or less also ,chase fair girls 

She told don't worry look at rajinikanth etc 

Like that's a guy 
Is she dumb 😭


That's not the way to console someone 
I hope she did it accidentally
8/14/24, 11:05 PM - Aishwarya: So some mix of things like that ,idk if she secretly wanted me to not be happy 

But probably not 
It's just my mind
8/14/24, 11:06 PM - Aishwarya: Coz she did help me with some stuff 
And he kind of adopted me into her friend group 🥺
When my previous friends had abandoned me 

So I think she did care about me
8/14/24, 11:06 PM - Aishwarya: She helps even some not so good people ,who were not her friends
8/14/24, 11:07 PM - Aishwarya: So she did care about me 
Coz I was one of the friends that she liked coz I was always on my good behavior with her
8/14/24, 11:09 PM - Aishwarya: But doesn't matter coz me and her grew apart 
Especially after she got married and all 
It's like I don't want kids ,and I don't want to feel less than women who have kids
Such reasons 
But we are still friends though even though not much in contact
8/14/24, 11:10 PM - Sayanth: Understandable
8/14/24, 11:10 PM - Aishwarya: Some other people who were good they were from other countries
8/14/24, 11:10 PM - Sayanth: Again I Can relate to that
8/14/24, 11:10 PM - Aishwarya: I hope I find more good people in life
8/14/24, 11:10 PM - Sayanth: Aaaahh u are just overthinking
8/14/24, 11:11 PM - Aishwarya: Okay
8/14/24, 11:11 PM - Sayanth: See u are not bad looking or anything u are not inferior to anyone ok!
8/14/24, 11:11 PM - Aishwarya: Ya probably
8/14/24, 11:11 PM - Sayanth: U are just insecure about things that's all
8/14/24, 11:11 PM - Aishwarya: Okay 🥹
8/14/24, 11:11 PM - Aishwarya: Ya
8/14/24, 11:12 PM - Sayanth: Next time just shoot ur shot
8/14/24, 11:12 PM - Aishwarya: Okay
8/14/24, 11:13 PM - Aishwarya: Btw you were so kind to that girl ,who you just met two days ago

You know me since some months right 
So I have more belief now that you will be there for me also 🥹
8/14/24, 11:17 PM - Aishwarya: First few times oke many people will be kind 
But then later they get annoyed 
But thankfully for me I'm not in a worse place like this girl 
Mostly okay aanu
8/14/24, 11:18 PM - Aishwarya: I hope she finds some way to deal with whatever problems she is facing
8/14/24, 11:20 PM - Sayanth: Yesss
8/14/24, 11:21 PM - Sayanth: Understandable
8/14/24, 11:38 PM - Aishwarya: I have seen the trolley post on reddit

8/17/24, 10:39 PM - Aishwarya: My college the friend group used to buy cake and cut it
8/17/24, 10:39 PM - Aishwarya: Even the small groups
8/17/24, 10:40 PM - Aishwarya: Like 3 to 5 people groups too
8/17/24, 10:40 PM - Aishwarya: But doesn't really mean anything though
8/17/24, 10:40 PM - Aishwarya: Coz some of them didn't really like them
8/17/24, 10:41 PM - Aishwarya: Mainly coz it was a trend like thing
8/17/24, 10:41 PM - Aishwarya: And to post on instagram stories
8/17/24, 10:44 PM - Aishwarya: I had saved a post related to some offer on cake in kannur🥹 that I had found on reels some time ago

8/18/24, 7:42 PM - Sayanth: And I'm having a really bad headache
8/18/24, 8:00 PM - Aishwarya: Oh :(
Take rest
8/18/24, 8:00 PM - Aishwarya: I will reply in detail after reading the post in detail 
Going to have dinner now
8/18/24, 8:41 PM - Sayanth: 40 Mins of dinner 🍽 🥺
8/18/24, 8:45 PM - Aishwarya: Yaa🤭😬
8/18/24, 8:46 PM - Aishwarya: I ate at almost 11 
Didn't eat anything after that 
So was eating so much 😬
8/18/24, 8:47 PM - Aishwarya: Plus it was chicken 
So couldn't waste anything 
I ate more rice to finish it off 🤭
8/18/24, 8:47 PM - Aishwarya: Gonna read the post now
8/18/24, 8:48 PM - Aishwarya: Oh and washing the dishes
8/18/24, 8:48 PM - Sayanth: 🥺🥲🥹
8/18/24, 8:48 PM - Sayanth: Yeah ok
8/18/24, 8:48 PM - Sayanth: Well text me after that
8/18/24, 8:48 PM - Aishwarya: Okay
8/18/24, 8:55 PM - Aishwarya: Hey
8/18/24, 8:55 PM - Aishwarya: First off
8/18/24, 8:55 PM - Aishwarya: When I finished reading the post,
8/18/24, 8:55 PM - Aishwarya: I thought why would you feel to share this post with a friend
8/18/24, 8:56 PM - Aishwarya: Coz the guy this girl is talking about is not like you at allll
8/18/24, 8:56 PM - Sayanth: He is 🥲
8/18/24, 8:56 PM - Aishwarya: Then I while reading the comments I saw your comment
8/18/24, 8:56 PM - Aishwarya: The comment starting with how
8/18/24, 8:57 PM - Aishwarya: Then I went to your account
8/18/24, 8:57 PM - Aishwarya: And saw the comment hm maybe you are him
8/18/24, 8:57 PM - Aishwarya: You are not ,imo
8/18/24, 8:58 PM - Aishwarya: I see 
Let me read it again 

Alsoo ,why do you feel you are like that though 


Probably the only thing that resonates is you messaging your first crush (ex crush ) even after she told not to contact her again
8/18/24, 8:59 PM - Aishwarya: But then again from your conversations with her that you screenshot of , you were caring towards her 
Not a toxic vibe you know 

Even though she prefers to have zero contacts with her ,due to her own reasons
8/18/24, 9:01 PM - Sayanth: I'd not have texted her tho but since she broke the no contact thing once we first blocked each other off I feel like since she tried to patch things up may be I should too and not be so stubborn
8/18/24, 9:01 PM - Aishwarya: How ? If all the persons are ok with it what's unethical or red flag about it? Isn't that more progressive ?

Also this comment is true 
The boundaries in a relationship varies from relationship to relationship 
So if both of the partners in the relationship are okay with it , that's not cheating 
Or a problem 

But they may or might not be a redder flag than other set of people
8/18/24, 9:03 PM - Aishwarya: But you told you are monogamous person right 

Like you said you want to be in a love relationship with a girl ,long term kinda 
( forever or not )


So by that comment you meant as a general opinion right?
8/18/24, 9:04 PM - Sayanth: Well I'm strictly monogamous I can never even think of being in relationship with 2 persons or loving more than 1
8/18/24, 9:04 PM - Aishwarya: Ohh so she broke the no contact thing first?

You were so kind to her still 
She was going off on you 🤭🥺
8/18/24, 9:06 PM - Aishwarya: Okay that's good 
Such guys tend to be better people ,by a bit , comparatively, imo

But girls are generally like that though
8/18/24, 9:07 PM - Aishwarya: I mean usually guys get kinda aggressive even when they are the ones in the wrong
8/18/24, 9:07 PM - Sayanth: As in if someone want to be in polygamy who am I to tell them otherwise it's their thing. Unless they are cheating or doing it forcefully
8/18/24, 9:07 PM - Aishwarya: So it's good 
In a way
Was good to see
8/18/24, 9:07 PM - Aishwarya: Ya true
8/18/24, 9:07 PM - Aishwarya: Back to the post and you
8/18/24, 9:08 PM - Aishwarya: How is he and you related ?🤔
8/18/24, 9:08 PM - Sayanth: Wait
8/18/24, 9:08 PM - Aishwarya: I didn't understand at all
8/18/24, 9:08 PM - Aishwarya: Okay
8/18/24, 9:12 PM - Aishwarya: The guy's behaviour doesn't sound objectively bad or problematic. OP admitted to inviting him for movies etc so that might have communicated a sense of friendship to the guy which he is acting up on. But if OP is uncomfortable, she can communicate and make her boundaries clear.

I agree with this comment
8/18/24, 9:13 PM - Sayanth: He's a nerd who loves discussing movies and intellectual theories,
8/18/24, 9:14 PM - Sayanth: >He's very comfortable around me
8/18/24, 9:14 PM - Sayanth: He wants to know everything about my life, from what I eat to my daily plans, and keeps texting me even on holidays.
8/18/24, 9:14 PM - Aishwarya: That's not good or bad 

I think many guys are like that ,talking about their interests 
Even girls
8/18/24, 9:15 PM - Aishwarya: This can make some people uncomfortable 
But again not bad, though 


If the other person is uncomfortable with that ,they can communicate that
8/18/24, 9:15 PM - Sayanth: During holidays, he wants to go somewhere and always asks me to join him, despite knowing I'm not interested.
8/18/24, 9:16 PM - Sayanth: He don’t have much friends here may bee that’s why but still……He supports polygamy and claims to be a progressive feminist,
8/18/24, 9:16 PM - Aishwarya: If I have friends like this and they keep on yapping about their interests to me ,I will say that I'm getting bored 
Especially if their interests don't align with me 


Without communicating the other person might not know it right
8/18/24, 9:16 PM - Sayanth: As I started avoiding him slightly, he picked up on it and openly asked me about it,
8/18/24, 9:17 PM - Sayanth: Yesss
8/18/24, 9:17 PM - Aishwarya: That most people do 
Especially if they don't have other friends 

And those with few friends asks or requests their few friends to include them too
8/18/24, 9:18 PM - Aishwarya: You don't identify as a feminist right ?

You just support equality in everything 
And you do empathize with women's issues ,coz women do go through much violence than men ( based on statistics)
8/18/24, 9:19 PM - Aishwarya: So you and him are not alike in that also I meant
8/18/24, 9:20 PM - Aishwarya: Ya ,nothing wrong in it
8/18/24, 9:22 PM - Sayanth: Tbh from my pov this girl sounds kinda red flag cuz she's not being honest or open with that boy and I can't see anything wrong with that boy, I understand it may make somepeople uncomfortable if they ask too much questions or personal info, and all I can see how it makes her uncomfortable but while the boy is being open she's not.
8/18/24, 9:23 PM - Sayanth: If she's uncomfortable she should clearly state that instead of giving hints or clues or just avoiding him
8/18/24, 9:23 PM - Sayanth: Because from my side I'd try everything I can do to save that friendship
8/18/24, 9:24 PM - Sayanth: So I do ask about it openly most of the time
8/18/24, 9:25 PM - Aishwarya: True 
Need to get more information on the situation to agree or disagree if the girl is a red flag though 
Especially since she made this post on reddit ( so it's anonymous)

Like there are girls who intentionally lead on guys, then act like the guy is behind her and not leaving her alone, that's a red flag
8/18/24, 9:25 PM - Aishwarya: True True 
Otherwise how will he know
8/18/24, 9:25 PM - Aishwarya: Ya
8/18/24, 9:26 PM - Aishwarya: That's good 
Ya
8/18/24, 9:26 PM - Sayanth: Yeah right I'd not call myself a feminist I don't want that label but still I guess some people may still label me as a feminist if they hear my stance.
8/18/24, 9:26 PM - Sayanth: <Media omitted>
8/18/24, 9:26 PM - Sayanth: This is her earlier post
8/18/24, 9:27 PM - Aishwarya: She is probably not unaware that she is leading him on ,even if it's a friendship 

Especially the inviting to movies etc 

Those are close friends activities
8/18/24, 9:27 PM - Sayanth: I had seen this one before that's why I said she sounds kinda red flag to me (about the communication thing)
8/18/24, 9:27 PM - Aishwarya: That's the most good way to be ,in that
8/18/24, 9:29 PM - Aishwarya: Omg the word lifeline 💀🤭

I have told my best friend in college that 🥹 before
8/18/24, 9:29 PM - Aishwarya: That was true though, at the time
8/18/24, 9:29 PM - Aishwarya: Felt grateful again for a moment 🥹
8/18/24, 9:30 PM - Aishwarya: Oh okay
8/18/24, 9:31 PM - Aishwarya: She actually bought gifts?🤔
Without even she feeling like they reciprocating no efforts in the friendship
8/18/24, 9:32 PM - Sayanth: She wants someone to be her friend like as best friend
8/18/24, 9:32 PM - Aishwarya: I have doubt if she did all this 
Because if so , people will flock to make friends with such people 
I think
8/18/24, 9:32 PM - Aishwarya: Even though she will get taken advantage of though
8/18/24, 9:33 PM - Aishwarya: Ya
8/18/24, 9:33 PM - Sayanth: But at the same time she's not exactly comfortable when he's kinda prioritizing her (assuming he got no romantic intention cuz she didn't mention anything like that)
8/18/24, 9:33 PM - Aishwarya: She is definitely bad the communication thing
8/18/24, 9:34 PM - Aishwarya: That's a friendship red flag 

But in depends 
In this situation just she is suffering from not communicating
8/18/24, 9:34 PM - Aishwarya: Maybe he is not the friend that she wants it from
8/18/24, 9:35 PM - Aishwarya: Example me , I have to like the vibe of a person to consider them my friend 

The same applies to many people
8/18/24, 9:36 PM - Aishwarya: And for some people , a lot of things have to be checked ,to pass the vibe check
8/18/24, 9:38 PM - Sayanth: Yes
8/18/24, 9:38 PM - Aishwarya: But some people they be friending anybody 

I think it's because they are either fake ,or they are very healthy mentally or delusional and see the world in too much positive light
8/18/24, 9:39 PM - Aishwarya: My best friend in college, she is the last two 
Good for her 

So she didn't have any enemies 
Can make friends easily 
Don't dislike anyone ,generally
8/18/24, 9:39 PM - Sayanth: I feel like may be she's actually looking for a romantic partner may be and he's giving her too much attention since he got not much friends there
8/18/24, 9:40 PM - Sayanth: Yeah remember that friend In video I posted while we went to have manthi
8/18/24, 9:40 PM - Sayanth: He's like that
8/18/24, 9:40 PM - Sayanth: Soooo positive
8/18/24, 9:40 PM - Sayanth: He's friendly with literally everyone
8/18/24, 9:41 PM - Sayanth: But he's a rare specimen
8/18/24, 9:41 PM - Sayanth: Kinda nerd
8/18/24, 9:41 PM - Aishwarya: She maybe looking for romantic partner 

But I don't think she wants him to be her romantic partner ,from the things she said
8/18/24, 9:41 PM - Sayanth: But extroverted
8/18/24, 9:41 PM - Sayanth: Yes
8/18/24, 9:41 PM - Sayanth: That's what I think too
8/18/24, 9:41 PM - Aishwarya: But I do think maybe she is leading him on though
For attention
8/18/24, 9:42 PM - Aishwarya: Oh 🥹
8/18/24, 9:42 PM - Sayanth: Could be may be she's doing that subconsciously cuz her parents were strict and she didn't have much friends.
8/18/24, 9:42 PM - Aishwarya: Oh the blue tshirt guy ??
8/18/24, 9:42 PM - Aishwarya: Oh
8/18/24, 9:42 PM - Aishwarya: I see
Nice 
Good for him
8/18/24, 9:43 PM - Aishwarya: I mean probably for attention from the opposite gender too 
Girls do that 
Even if they don't like that guy
8/18/24, 9:44 PM - Sayanth: Yeah him
8/18/24, 9:45 PM - Aishwarya: My best friend in college ,she told about a guy that ' avane korch pokki paranjal mathi ,to get homework ' in a group 

I don't think she understands that's it's kinda insulting for the guy 

I understand that coz I have gone through similar
8/18/24, 9:45 PM - Aishwarya: Okay
8/18/24, 9:45 PM - Sayanth: Yeah also he got not much mental trauma either but physical a lot
8/18/24, 9:45 PM - Sayanth: 🙂
8/18/24, 9:45 PM - Sayanth: That's feel sad
8/18/24, 9:45 PM - Aishwarya: Ohh 
I'm curious 
But idk if I can ask ,what that means
8/18/24, 9:45 PM - Sayanth: Well nsfw I guess
8/18/24, 9:46 PM - Aishwarya: Oh its okay for me to hear
8/18/24, 9:46 PM - Sayanth: But once he slammed his Balls to table accidentally
8/18/24, 9:46 PM - Sayanth: Had to do surgery
8/18/24, 9:46 PM - Aishwarya: Ohh 🥺
8/18/24, 9:46 PM - Aishwarya: Okay 🥺😭
8/18/24, 9:46 PM - Sayanth: Then he fell into a small valley like thing while riding cycle
8/18/24, 9:46 PM - Aishwarya: Oh
8/18/24, 9:46 PM - Sayanth: Was in icu for 2 or 3 weeks
8/18/24, 9:47 PM - Sayanth: Took almost 1 years to recover fully
8/18/24, 9:47 PM - Aishwarya: Oh 🥺
8/18/24, 9:47 PM - Aishwarya: Oh 🥺
8/18/24, 9:48 PM - Sayanth: Yeah
8/18/24, 9:48 PM - Sayanth: He got really really bad luck
8/18/24, 9:48 PM - Aishwarya: I also kinda lead him on ( I think that's not the word though)
But I had liked him lowkey 
Plus I have never told about anything to anyone 
So it's different
8/18/24, 9:49 PM - Sayanth: Also yeah once he was visiting our beach and there was this couple ( students) getting harassed by some moral policing guys
8/18/24, 9:49 PM - Sayanth: And he tried to intervene
8/18/24, 9:50 PM - Aishwarya: But some girls do that just for attention, even when they see the guy as less than them or something 

Even that is okay ,coz it's just thoughts in mind 

But telling about it to others ,is insulting to the other person, which is when it is wrong
8/18/24, 9:50 PM - Aishwarya: Ya🥺
8/18/24, 9:50 PM - Sayanth: Didn't end well for him got into fight, not exactly a fight they just beat him up and he filed a complaint
8/18/24, 9:50 PM - Sayanth: That guy got arrested but
8/18/24, 9:50 PM - Sayanth: The worst part
8/18/24, 9:50 PM - Aishwarya: Ohh
8/18/24, 9:50 PM - Aishwarya: Oh that's good
8/18/24, 9:50 PM - Aishwarya: Ohhhh
8/18/24, 9:50 PM - Sayanth: The newspaper published The news labeling him as Gunda
8/18/24, 9:50 PM - Sayanth: 😃
8/18/24, 9:50 PM - Aishwarya: Ohh😭
8/18/24, 9:50 PM - Sayanth: Yup
8/18/24, 9:52 PM - Aishwarya: He got beaten up right

So how were they able to publish news in that way
8/18/24, 9:52 PM - Aishwarya: I mean more beating
8/18/24, 9:52 PM - Sayanth: Well idk
8/18/24, 9:52 PM - Aishwarya: Oh all the parties in the fight
8/18/24, 9:52 PM - Aishwarya: Were labeled gunda
8/18/24, 9:52 PM - Sayanth: Yeah he didn't hit them actually
8/18/24, 9:52 PM - Aishwarya: In news
8/18/24, 9:52 PM - Sayanth: Yes
8/18/24, 9:52 PM - Aishwarya: Ohh
8/18/24, 9:53 PM - Aishwarya: Then that's more sad for him 🥺
8/18/24, 9:53 PM - Aishwarya: But they hit him ??
8/18/24, 9:54 PM - Aishwarya: I mean but they hit him right?
That's double sad 

I would be so mad
8/18/24, 9:54 PM - Aishwarya: So unfortunate
8/18/24, 9:55 PM - Aishwarya: Did the couple thank him ?
Any other details related to the situation that happened you know?
8/18/24, 9:55 PM - Sayanth: Yeah
8/18/24, 9:55 PM - Aishwarya: Oh🥺
8/18/24, 9:55 PM - Sayanth: Well there was 2 guys
8/18/24, 9:55 PM - Aishwarya: Okay
8/18/24, 9:55 PM - Aishwarya: Also
8/18/24, 9:55 PM - Aishwarya: I wanted to ask something
8/18/24, 9:56 PM - Aishwarya: Else
8/18/24, 9:56 PM - Aishwarya: Related to him
8/18/24, 9:56 PM - Sayanth: Whats it

8/18/24, 9:56 PM - Aishwarya: I just got curious
8/18/24, 9:56 PM - Sayanth: Ok
8/18/24, 9:56 PM - Aishwarya: Like his girlfriend
8/18/24, 9:56 PM - Aishwarya: Does she look better than him ?
8/18/24, 9:56 PM - Aishwarya: I mean like in conventionally sense there is levels right
8/18/24, 9:57 PM - Aishwarya: Like we see a couple and think 
Oh they both are kinda equal attractiveness
8/18/24, 9:57 PM - Aishwarya: Or
8/18/24, 9:57 PM - Aishwarya: The girl looks more good
8/18/24, 9:57 PM - Aishwarya: Like that
8/18/24, 9:58 PM - Aishwarya: Sorry I just got curious 🥹
8/18/24, 9:58 PM - Aishwarya: Butttt
8/18/24, 9:58 PM - Aishwarya: You don't have to sayyy
8/18/24, 9:58 PM - Aishwarya: Ifff
8/18/24, 9:58 PM - Sayanth: Idk tbh
8/18/24, 9:58 PM - Aishwarya: You don't want to
8/18/24, 9:58 PM - Aishwarya: Oh :(

Okay hehe
8/18/24, 9:59 PM - Aishwarya: Like this is one of my interests btw😅
8/18/24, 9:59 PM - Aishwarya: Observing this
8/18/24, 9:59 PM - Aishwarya: Lol
8/18/24, 9:59 PM - Sayanth: Well she's a 10 from my pov she's good at studies, she's good at extra curricular activities, she even got some international awards and some Guinness book record or something related to dancing
8/18/24, 10:00 PM - Sayanth: I don't think she's bad looking in anyway
8/18/24, 10:00 PM - Aishwarya: Okayy 
That's good 

But I was asking just looks vise
8/18/24, 10:00 PM - Aishwarya: Okay
8/18/24, 10:00 PM - Sayanth: But again his pov and mine would be totally different since she's just my classmate and for him it's his gf
8/18/24, 10:00 PM - Sayanth: Oh ok
8/18/24, 10:01 PM - Sayanth: Hm I think they are equal I guess
8/18/24, 10:01 PM - Aishwarya: I hope she and he is matched in looks 
🥹

Idk I don't like guys with much more better looking girls 
Especially if they are good guys ,my delulu is ruined 

It's like if good guys are like that ,then who is gonna provide life partner for my average looking sistas🥹💀
8/18/24, 10:02 PM - Aishwarya: Ya true
8/18/24, 10:02 PM - Aishwarya: Okay then 🥹
Match made in heaven 🥹
8/18/24, 10:04 PM - Aishwarya: Dw your match in looks is cute 

I was not talking about you 

So i won't dislike you coz of that
8/18/24, 10:07 PM - Aishwarya: Also even your friend is cute, in different way
Plus I think he is kinda medium fair, can't see from pic ,so like not brown I mean 

 So the statement not applicable towards him also okay😊
8/18/24, 10:08 PM - Aishwarya: Oh anddd
8/18/24, 10:08 PM - Aishwarya: One guy in your instagram picture
8/18/24, 10:08 PM - Aishwarya: He kinda reminds me of
8/18/24, 10:08 PM - Aishwarya: My best friend in college
8/18/24, 10:08 PM - Aishwarya: Her ex💀
8/18/24, 10:08 PM - Aishwarya: But he has more good face though
8/18/24, 10:09 PM - Aishwarya: But her ex was bit musclely
That's about it
8/18/24, 10:10 PM - Aishwarya: He was the one of the reasons why I grew to dislike her a bit 

Like he commented on my looks and she didn't say anything to defend me 🙂

And I couldn't insult him back at the time 
Coz he was her boyfriend
8/18/24, 10:17 PM - Aishwarya: For example like ,chai lenin is cuter than you 
But you are stil cute than many guys in kerala yk

So it's not a loss for average girls in your age range
8/18/24, 10:17 PM - Aishwarya: 🙂💀
Please excuse the phrasing
8/18/24, 10:17 PM - Sayanth: I'm not cute 😭😭😭
8/18/24, 10:17 PM - Aishwarya: You are 🥹
8/18/24, 10:17 PM - Sayanth: Yeah she's so cute 🌚
8/18/24, 10:17 PM - Aishwarya: Yaaa
8/18/24, 10:23 PM - Sayanth: Hey brb
8/18/24, 10:23 PM - Sayanth: 10 mins

8/18/24, 11:00 PM - Sayanth: Sorry
8/18/24, 11:00 PM - Aishwarya: It's okay
8/18/24, 11:00 PM - Aishwarya: Hey
8/18/24, 11:00 PM - Aishwarya: Welcome back 😊
8/18/24, 11:01 PM - Sayanth: Understandable
8/18/24, 11:01 PM - Aishwarya: I see🥹
Thanks
8/18/24, 11:01 PM - Sayanth: Yeah she should've
8/18/24, 11:02 PM - Aishwarya: Yk one guy was like kinda disagreeing saying looks don't matter 
He just wanted an average girl
8/18/24, 11:02 PM - Aishwarya: He's average 
But like he is slim in his 30s so idk
8/18/24, 11:02 PM - Sayanth: Oh
8/18/24, 11:02 PM - Aishwarya: Anyways at the time of marriage he was average, compared to other guys at the time
8/18/24, 11:03 PM - Aishwarya: Like some guys gain fat
8/18/24, 11:03 PM - Aishwarya: And his wife is above average kinda
8/18/24, 11:03 PM - Aishwarya: Which is okay
8/18/24, 11:03 PM - Aishwarya: It was an arrange marriage set up
8/18/24, 11:04 PM - Aishwarya: I was having good opinion of this guy 
He literally listened to me yap on phone for 2 hours 
For free
8/18/24, 11:05 PM - Sayanth: Oh and
8/18/24, 11:05 PM - Aishwarya: But like later when he texted the third time 
He texted on reddit 
Idk why to message on reddit, coz we already talked twice on whatsapp
8/18/24, 11:06 PM - Aishwarya: And I just simply opened his account and saw that he has been commenting on nsfw of many indian subreddit girls
8/18/24, 11:06 PM - Aishwarya: I told him that I don't want to be friends ( not really friends but acquaintance) with such a person who cheats on his wife
8/18/24, 11:07 PM - Aishwarya: I think he wanted me know that he is lowkey cheating 
And wanted some validation that it's not wrong
8/18/24, 11:07 PM - Aishwarya: I had totally forgot about him 
If he didn't have texted on reddit ,I wouldn't even know which his account was
8/18/24, 11:08 PM - Sayanth: Whut the fuk
8/18/24, 11:08 PM - Aishwarya: It gave a little bit more trust issues 🙂💀
Coz I actually judged him as good <This message was edited>
8/18/24, 11:08 PM - Aishwarya: Yaa💯😑
8/18/24, 11:08 PM - Sayanth: Yeah of course
8/18/24, 11:08 PM - Aishwarya: Ya
8/18/24, 11:14 PM - Aishwarya: In the sense some people are not so good like I thought 🥺
8/18/24, 11:14 PM - Aishwarya: Coz he helped a stranger
8/18/24, 11:15 PM - Aishwarya: But not good to someone who is his wife ( a close person who people care about )
And he put his selfish desires above his wifes mental health etc
8/18/24, 11:17 PM - Aishwarya: <Media omitted>
8/18/24, 11:19 PM - Aishwarya: He had told me he is lonely especially after he moved to US
8/18/24, 11:20 PM - Aishwarya: And he ghosted me
8/18/24, 11:21 PM - Aishwarya: Btw he is kind of guy who seeks validation in multiple girls 
He had told me about some girls he met in US
8/18/24, 11:22 PM - Aishwarya: This is the worse kind of guys 
But he had lot of female friends irl 
I feel bad for them
8/18/24, 11:22 PM - Sayanth: Oh
8/18/24, 11:22 PM - Sayanth: Oh
8/18/24, 11:22 PM - Aishwarya: Like, I just wanted to say how some guys are
8/18/24, 11:23 PM - Aishwarya: You might know only your experience as a guy yk
8/18/24, 11:23 PM - Aishwarya: About guys
8/18/24, 11:23 PM - Aishwarya: Mostly
8/18/24, 11:23 PM - Aishwarya: I mean he helped a stranger ,me
8/18/24, 11:23 PM - Sayanth: I had once emptied my account to donate to a dog rescue organization they were low on money for a immediate surgery so I felt bad
8/18/24, 11:24 PM - Aishwarya: Listening for 2 hours 
That meant a lot to me 
During the time 

I had found him from a comment on a post 
The post was made by a suicidal girl 
He had commented it will pass,I can listen etc
8/18/24, 11:25 PM - Sayanth: But it was only 1k and it's not exactly my money but parent's but yeah it was something I saved up for buying biscuits
8/18/24, 11:25 PM - Sayanth: Oh
8/18/24, 11:25 PM - Sayanth: Yeah
8/18/24, 11:25 PM - Aishwarya: Oh🥺🥹😇
8/18/24, 11:26 PM - Aishwarya: Oh 🥺🥹
That's good
8/18/24, 11:26 PM - Aishwarya: So kind I mean
8/18/24, 11:27 PM - Sayanth: Tbh I wanna start a dog shelter for rescued Stray Dogs abandoned ones
8/18/24, 11:27 PM - Aishwarya: The guys who are not thattt insecure plus seeking that validation from girls ,they are the best 
Like they make good friends 
Asset to society 🥹
8/18/24, 11:28 PM - Aishwarya: My kolkata friend 
He is like that

But sadly he is too much into caste 💀
8/18/24, 11:29 PM - Aishwarya: Like the recent rape situation it happened there right 
He had told about how Hinduism respects women 

Idk why make everything about religion and caste
8/18/24, 11:30 PM - Aishwarya: Idk if it's coz he felt kinda ashamed that it happened in his state though 

Like he used to say that west bengal guys are good 
I used to agree
8/18/24, 11:30 PM - Aishwarya: Ohhhhhh🥹🥺
8/18/24, 11:32 PM - Aishwarya: Like the guys from north east tend to be less misogynistic comparatively 
Coz they are brought up in not so much patriarchy 

But not much use to me in any way though 
Coz north east guys are one of the most colorist guys in india 
But they are fair themselves, so it's okay 
I mean idc coz atleast they themselves are fair right
8/18/24, 11:33 PM - Aishwarya: My crush has 7 dogs in his house 
But sometimes I feel how he care for dogs so much 
But not his girlfriend
8/18/24, 11:34 PM - Aishwarya: But guys who care about their girlfriend and dogs are green flags 
Like good people 🥹
8/18/24, 11:34 PM - Sayanth: I mean yeah in someways it does but u don't really need religion or holy books to respect another individual
8/18/24, 11:34 PM - Aishwarya: Even though I don't like dogs ,especially big ones irl
Coz they are scary in my mind
8/18/24, 11:35 PM - Aishwarya: True
8/18/24, 11:35 PM - Sayanth: Oh
8/18/24, 11:36 PM - Sayanth: They aren't .exceptions are there but most dogs don't even try to scare anyone they just wanna play
8/18/24, 11:37 PM - Aishwarya: Idk even he is not annoying like the other set of guys 
The validation ones 

But it's a different story if he is someone who makes fun of lower caste people though 
But still he is not good friend vibe 
Coz some of his views are very off
8/18/24, 11:37 PM - Aishwarya: Ya that's true
8/18/24, 11:38 PM - Sayanth: So my cousin's are shit scared of dogs
8/18/24, 11:38 PM - Sayanth: Like they'd literally get a heart attack if my dog tried to climb on them
8/18/24, 11:38 PM - Sayanth: Oh
8/18/24, 11:38 PM - Aishwarya: Plus the fact that he is fair 💀

Idk my tolerance level in that case is way high
8/18/24, 11:38 PM - Aishwarya: Tolerance for bs
8/18/24, 11:39 PM - Aishwarya: Ohh okay
8/18/24, 11:39 PM - Aishwarya: Ohh
8/18/24, 11:39 PM - Aishwarya: Small dogs aren't scary to me 
It's the big ones 
But yea it depends 
They are mostly safe only
8/18/24, 11:41 PM - Aishwarya: I'm bit scared of cats too
The nails
8/18/24, 11:41 PM - Aishwarya: If not I could have a cat
8/18/24, 11:41 PM - Aishwarya: That would be nice 🥹
8/18/24, 11:42 PM - Sayanth: Yeah if they get angry it's over
8/18/24, 11:42 PM - Aishwarya: Ya😭💀
8/18/24, 11:42 PM - Sayanth: Cuz unlike dogs cats aren't usually friendly
8/18/24, 11:42 PM - Aishwarya: Oh
8/18/24, 11:42 PM - Sayanth: And don't like touching then
8/18/24, 11:43 PM - Aishwarya: Ya
8/18/24, 11:43 PM - Aishwarya: True
8/18/24, 11:43 PM - Aishwarya: I once asked someone can the nails be removed 😅
But yea not possible 
And its insensitive 🙂
8/18/24, 11:44 PM - Sayanth: They can be
8/18/24, 11:44 PM - Sayanth: But it's painful procedure
8/18/24, 11:44 PM - Aishwarya: Ya
8/18/24, 11:44 PM - Sayanth: And I don't think u could do that if u actually love them
8/18/24, 11:45 PM - Aishwarya: Ya:(😭
8/18/24, 11:45 PM - Aishwarya: True
8/18/24, 11:45 PM - Sayanth: And it makes it harder for them walk
8/18/24, 11:45 PM - Aishwarya: Ya
8/18/24, 11:45 PM - Aishwarya: 🥺
8/18/24, 11:46 PM - Aishwarya: One of my favorite youtuber had rabbits
8/18/24, 11:46 PM - Aishwarya: I think rabbits don't have any tools to attack right
8/18/24, 11:46 PM - Aishwarya: But the rabbits used to chew the wires in the house 😭
8/18/24, 11:48 PM - Aishwarya: https://youtu.be/e-1_jnqy6to?si=bo5Ei8fmm_1jLyxP
8/18/24, 11:48 PM - Aishwarya: They are so safe 🥹
Like fully
8/18/24, 11:48 PM - Aishwarya: But will chew wires
8/18/24, 11:49 PM - Aishwarya: Does cats and dogs do this kind of stuff too ?

Like causing damage to non living objects in house?
I think no right
8/18/24, 11:58 PM - Sayanth: Yesss
8/18/24, 11:59 PM - Sayanth: They chew on everything
8/18/24, 11:59 PM - Sayanth: No they bite
8/18/24, 11:59 PM - Aishwarya: Oh :(
8/18/24, 11:59 PM - Sayanth: Cats not much
8/18/24, 11:59 PM - Sayanth: Dogs yeah
8/18/24, 11:59 PM - Sayanth: Usually the pups

8/19/24, 12:01 AM - Aishwarya: Even after training
8/19/24, 12:01 AM - Sayanth: Also u can just cut nails like we do for ourselves instead of removing the nails entirely
8/19/24, 12:01 AM - Aishwarya: Btw don't take pitbulls in shelter if possible
8/19/24, 12:01 AM - Sayanth: Nooo
8/19/24, 12:01 AM - Aishwarya: If you start the shelter
8/19/24, 12:02 AM - Sayanth: Dogs usually are so friendly they won't bite u without any reason
8/19/24, 12:02 AM - Aishwarya: But the nails comes out and goes inside right 🤔
8/19/24, 12:02 AM - Aishwarya: Oh

8/19/24, 12:03 AM - Aishwarya: https://www.reddit.com/r/BanPitBulls/s/7JT7lE2HQ7
8/19/24, 12:03 AM - Sayanth: Most of the times it's cuz people annoy dogs that's why they bite

8/19/24, 12:07 AM - Sayanth: Hey dw
8/19/24, 12:07 AM - Sayanth: Dogs don't attack they are specifically selected by humans to be more friendly
8/19/24, 12:07 AM - Aishwarya: Ya doesn't really matter 
But better if don't adopt that
8/19/24, 12:07 AM - Aishwarya: Oh

8/19/24, 12:07 AM - Aishwarya: Oh

8/19/24, 12:09 AM - Sayanth: Unless that human does something stupid like trying to scare the dog or annoy it or run from it. But still most dogs are not like that
8/19/24, 12:09 AM - Aishwarya: Oh okay 
Then that's good
8/19/24, 12:09 AM - Sayanth: Im yet to see a dog attacking someone irl, and I literally pet almost all the dogs I see

8/19/24, 12:12 AM - Aishwarya: Oh okay
8/19/24, 12:13 AM - Sayanth: Most of the time if dog is running to u it's cuz they want to hug u
8/19/24, 12:13 AM - Aishwarya: Oh

I didn't focus on the message clearly
8/19/24, 8:31 PM - Aishwarya: Oh

8/19/24, 8:31 PM - Aishwarya: I think i have heard

8/19/24, 8:32 PM - Aishwarya: But why did that person ask me if I'm a minor ? When I asked to explain the meme
8/19/24, 8:32 PM - Sayanth: whaaat
8/19/24, 8:32 PM - Sayanth: wait doesn't make sense
8/19/24, 8:32 PM - Sayanth: who
8/19/24, 8:32 PM - Sayanth: would u like to show me the entire convo or context
8/19/24, 8:32 PM - Sayanth: ?
8/19/24, 8:33 PM - Aishwarya: A redditor ,i was asking a doubt 
And then I was asking him about how he went Germany
8/19/24, 8:36 PM - Sayanth: Under communist rule, Poland's economy suffered greatly due to excessive money printing by the government. To fund its programs and maintain control, the government printed too much currency, causing severe inflation. This made money lose its value, leading to high prices and making life difficult for ordinary people. The economy became inefficient, with shortages of basic goods and widespread poverty, leaving the country in a weak economic state even after communism ended.
8/19/24, 8:36 PM - Sayanth: this
8/19/24, 8:36 PM - Sayanth: basically when Poland was under commie rule
8/19/24, 8:37 PM - Aishwarya: 
8/19/24, 8:37 PM - Aishwarya: Oh okay
8/19/24, 8:38 PM - Aishwarya: How is being minor relevant here though ,why he asked me that 
Anyways
8/19/24, 8:38 PM - Aishwarya: Probably coz I didn't know some basics, idk
8/19/24, 8:39 PM - Aishwarya: https://youtu.be/WU8bUccTojs?si=EEyn2fHcRpeWPENI

8/19/24, 8:40 PM - Aishwarya: I thought it was from that srinivasan and mohanlal movie at first
8/19/24, 8:40 PM - Aishwarya: Oh 😭💀

8/19/24, 8:41 PM - Aishwarya: Usually I do💀
8/19/24, 8:43 PM - Aishwarya: <Media omitted>
8/19/24, 8:43 PM - Aishwarya: I was asking this
8/19/24, 8:44 PM - Aishwarya: <Media omitted>
8/19/24, 8:46 PM - Sayanth: well if u are going to some country thats in the European Union then u dont need any other paper works to visit other countries that are also in European union
8/19/24, 8:46 PM - Sayanth: UK isn't part of EU now so yeah its not possible to visit there without further legal things
8/19/24, 8:46 PM - Sayanth: its from sandhesham
8/19/24, 8:47 PM - Aishwarya: Ya true
8/19/24, 8:47 PM - Aishwarya: I thought UK was part of EU
8/19/24, 8:47 PM - Aishwarya: But now it's not
8/19/24, 8:47 PM - Sayanth: it was but BREXIT happened
8/19/24, 8:47 PM - Aishwarya: Ya
I didn't know
8/19/24, 8:48 PM - Sayanth: so yeah the commies printed so much currency thinking it would increase wealth
8/19/24, 8:48 PM - Sayanth: cuz according to them
8/19/24, 8:48 PM - Sayanth: wealth = currency
8/19/24, 8:48 PM - Aishwarya: Oh you know information on many things 🥹

Or is all this basic information and just I don't know 🥺
8/19/24, 8:49 PM - Aishwarya: 🤔anyways it's okay 
I guess I should update my GK😬😭
8/19/24, 8:49 PM - Sayanth: which isn't thus they kinda destroyed the economy entirely
8/19/24, 8:49 PM - Aishwarya: Ya
8/19/24, 8:49 PM - Aishwarya: Okay
8/19/24, 8:50 PM - Aishwarya: Ya true
8/19/24, 8:50 PM - Sayanth: i mean it is kinda basic GK but well its not something that really affects us also if u ask about this to any of my classmates or family they wouldn't know it either so i guess its not exactly that important for us
8/19/24, 8:52 PM - Aishwarya: Oh okay 
I feel relieved now 
Thanks 🥹

Also feeling lowkey grateful that i have a friend who has more basic GK than general population
8/19/24, 8:55 PM - Aishwarya: I didn't check his profile or anything 
But later I lowkey felt like probably my future friend ?
But then I remembered the guy who went USA 
He was literally using theri language in reddit comments , like many times
In malayalam 
This guy also gives that vibe, although I didn't check  
Why are many guys like this though
8/19/24, 8:55 PM - Aishwarya: Also I wanted to say something, forgot
8/19/24, 8:55 PM - Aishwarya: To say
8/19/24, 8:56 PM - Sayanth: remember
8/19/24, 8:56 PM - Aishwarya: Ya I had remembered now
8/19/24, 8:57 PM - Sayanth: Me getting jealous 🥺
8/19/24, 8:58 PM - Aishwarya: Btw what I meant yesterday is, guys having sex with girls for validation 
And then sometimes boasting about it to others 
Such stuff 
Not you 🥺

I just wanted to clarify, just in case 
I know that you just kinda use pick up lines and stuff on reddit 🤭
Probably simply for fun or you trying to improve your social skills, or a mix of both 

But what I meant is different case btw
8/19/24, 8:58 PM - Aishwarya: This
8/19/24, 8:59 PM - Aishwarya: I know you didn't think it's about you in any way 
But just in caseeee
8/19/24, 9:00 PM - Aishwarya: You are the best 
No reason to be jealous 

People who have you in their life is blessed 
Such a good person, atleast comparatively 
And a guy 
A miracle 🥹
Kindaa
8/19/24, 9:03 PM - Aishwarya: The west bengal friend 
He is like that too 
He is not someone who is desperate to get laid with many cute girls, to seek validation 
But unfortunately he has some views regarding Hinduism and stuff
8/19/24, 9:03 PM - Aishwarya: A very few more guys I know, who is like that 
Not friends though
8/19/24, 9:04 PM - Aishwarya: But I know some guys who are like that for sure 
And I don't know many guys
8/19/24, 9:04 PM - Aishwarya: Soo the statistics
8/19/24, 9:06 PM - Aishwarya: Just yesterday I was just thinking 
That you are a good person 🥹 
Probably might feel like I'm saying simply
8/19/24, 9:06 PM - Aishwarya: And to have you as friend 🥹
8/19/24, 9:07 PM - Aishwarya: But also I don't really pay much attention to that 
Coz I used to have the same opinion of a veryyy few others too 
And look what happened 💀
8/19/24, 9:09 PM - Aishwarya: In guys probably like 5 who I thought like that 
But two of them are still like that though ,so I was not wrong 
Not my friends 
I just met them long ago ,and drifted apart
8/19/24, 9:09 PM - Aishwarya: One is an ex muslim guy from kerala 
He seems to be good 
Atleast alright
8/19/24, 9:10 PM - Aishwarya: Another is guy in bangalore 
He deleted his reddit account 
But he is still there on telegram ,can see the last seen kinda thing 
I thought were he went
8/19/24, 9:16 PM - Aishwarya: Oh and there was another guy who I knew 
But only for two week or so we were in contact
8/19/24, 9:18 PM - Aishwarya: He was a really good person
He had a crush in college and was asking me what to do etc 
I was just giving him advice from a female perspective
8/19/24, 9:18 PM - Aishwarya: He was 21
Your age range
8/19/24, 9:19 PM - Aishwarya: But then I was talking about my stuff and then he got tired of it I think 
But like I didn't say much even 😭
8/19/24, 9:20 PM - Aishwarya: I listened to him
8/19/24, 9:21 PM - Aishwarya: I read the hindi message between him and the girl 
Hindi idk that well
8/19/24, 9:21 PM - Aishwarya: Like I had put some time and given some support
8/19/24, 9:22 PM - Aishwarya: But regardless he was good
8/19/24, 9:23 PM - Aishwarya: But I guess my ranting back then was more 💀😭
So he got annoyed probably 
But it was just two days though 
Something had happened and I wanted to talk about it
8/19/24, 9:23 PM - Aishwarya: Like actually he listened to that 
He didn't get annoyed
8/19/24, 9:24 PM - Aishwarya: But then later another day i was talking about a problem with a guy 
And ngl I was going off on the guy who I had problem with
8/19/24, 9:24 PM - Aishwarya: I think that got him annoyed 🙂
8/19/24, 9:24 PM - Aishwarya: But that other guy is the one who started the problem
8/19/24, 9:25 PM - Aishwarya: So I don't think it's wrong to talk about it
8/19/24, 9:25 PM - Aishwarya: But like this guy have the right to not want to listen 
Or get annoyed
Coz it's his time
8/19/24, 9:29 PM - Aishwarya: <Media omitted>
8/19/24, 9:29 PM - Aishwarya: <Media omitted>
8/19/24, 9:33 PM - Aishwarya: <Media omitted>

Not just telling what happened
8/19/24, 9:44 PM - Aishwarya: Okay so

8/19/24, 10:17 PM - Sayanth: Can u give them some other fake names Instead of letters
8/19/24, 10:17 PM - Sayanth: 🥲
8/19/24, 10:17 PM - Aishwarya: Oh okay
8/19/24, 10:18 PM - Sayanth: Ok got it
8/19/24, 10:18 PM - Aishwarya: Oh okay then
8/19/24, 10:18 PM - Sayanth: Yeah that's unethical
8/19/24, 10:18 PM - Aishwarya: That's good
8/19/24, 10:18 PM - Aishwarya: Yaa
8/19/24, 10:18 PM - Aishwarya: And Y got so much trauma 🥺
8/19/24, 10:18 PM - Sayanth: She knew he was cheating on y
8/19/24, 10:18 PM - Aishwarya: Yess
8/19/24, 10:19 PM - Aishwarya: And also she took Y's boyfriend
8/19/24, 10:20 PM - Aishwarya: Like bit later ,guy named X got into relationship with girl named Z
8/19/24, 10:20 PM - Aishwarya: And also Z is prettier than Y
8/19/24, 10:21 PM - Sayanth: That's not relevant at all
8/19/24, 10:21 PM - Aishwarya: And then one year later something happened
8/19/24, 10:21 PM - Aishwarya: Okay 😅
8/19/24, 10:21 PM - Sayanth: X knew what he was doing is wrong
8/19/24, 10:21 PM - Sayanth: So does z
8/19/24, 10:21 PM - Sayanth: Z is kinda dumb too cuz what if he does the same to her too
8/19/24, 10:21 PM - Aishwarya: Yaaa
I mean if the girl is prettier the trauma will be more 

It's related to psychology
8/19/24, 10:21 PM - Sayanth: Yeah
8/19/24, 10:22 PM - Aishwarya: Yes yes 
Such relationships don't last 

Coz cheaters don't change
8/19/24, 10:22 PM - Aishwarya: Usually
8/19/24, 10:22 PM - Sayanth: What
8/19/24, 10:23 PM - Aishwarya: Ya she is wrong too
Coz she knew that X is Y's🥺 <This message was edited>
8/19/24, 10:26 PM - Aishwarya: A year later ,Y was going on a night ride, in her car in highway 
Not many vehicles were there 

Y sees a car accident and stops, to go and help 

Another car before her ,saw the accident, but they either didn't see the accident coz of low visibility 
Or they didn't want to get involved 

Hypothetical situation ,so light in road was less
8/19/24, 10:27 PM - Aishwarya: And then Y saw that it's X and Z who got into the accident
8/19/24, 10:27 PM - Aishwarya: 😅😅😅
8/19/24, 10:27 PM - Aishwarya: Like Y is not responsible for the accident ofcourse
8/19/24, 10:28 PM - Aishwarya: Coz the accident happened either coz they drove in overspeed 
Or they got unlucky and got into the car accident
8/19/24, 10:29 PM - Sayanth: Ok
8/19/24, 10:31 PM - Aishwarya: Two possibility of actions
Y helps Z and X by taking them in her car and carrying them to the hospital ,hence saving their lives 

And second possibility Y changes her mind about helping and goes back into her car 
Z and X bleeds and dies 

Hypothetical btw
8/19/24, 10:32 PM - Aishwarya: Hypothetical situations

Coz this never gonna happen in the first place
8/19/24, 10:32 PM - Sayanth: Ok got it
8/19/24, 10:32 PM - Aishwarya: Y was actually gonna help 
Before seeing its Z and X
8/19/24, 10:33 PM - Sayanth: Ok
8/19/24, 10:33 PM - Aishwarya: Unlike the car before Y who just went by without stopping
8/19/24, 10:33 PM - Aishwarya: Probably there will be some next car who will stop 
Coz there are helpful minded  people ofcourse
8/19/24, 10:34 PM - Aishwarya: But it was kind of an outbreak time like covid 
So that possibility of next car was less 

And the light visibility also less
8/19/24, 10:35 PM - Aishwarya: Okay, so if Y didn't help 
And Z and X dies
8/19/24, 10:35 PM - Aishwarya: What's your judgement of Y in that case
8/19/24, 10:36 PM - Aishwarya: Answer honestly btw
8/19/24, 10:38 PM - Aishwarya: https://www.instagram.com/reel/C8hy2FWNBDz/?igsh=Y2w4Njd6eXF2Njh2
8/19/24, 10:38 PM - Sayanth: Well in that case It's not exactly Y's responsibility to help them. She could she might but she doesn't owe them anything. And she didn't cause the accident. It's not her fault at all. So if she wants to help them ok if she doesn't that too is ok
8/19/24, 10:38 PM - Aishwarya: Btw just sending this to remind 
Ofcourse physical trauma and mental trauma is not the same
8/19/24, 10:38 PM - Aishwarya: Okay 🥹
8/19/24, 10:39 PM - Aishwarya: Thanks
8/19/24, 10:39 PM - Aishwarya: Such an understanding answer
8/19/24, 10:40 PM - Aishwarya: Like maybe you can do different 
But to have capability to understand other people's mindset
8/19/24, 10:40 PM - Aishwarya: Yk my Kolkata friend judged me for this
8/19/24, 10:41 PM - Sayanth: That being said I'd probably help them but even if she doesn't want to help them nothing is really wrong with it. It's not her responsibility at all. I'd suggest trying to save them but again that's entirely upto her and I don't think I can blame her knowing what she's been through
8/19/24, 10:41 PM - Aishwarya: And he is not someone who cares enough about others in the first place ,so what right does he have to judge Y <This message was edited>
8/19/24, 10:41 PM - Aishwarya: Okay 🥹🥹
8/19/24, 10:41 PM - Aishwarya: The best type of people 🥹
8/19/24, 10:44 PM - Aishwarya: This ofcourse clear but I'm the Y in the hypothetical situation
8/19/24, 10:45 PM - Aishwarya: So I was curious
8/19/24, 10:45 PM - Sayanth: I don't really think a sane normal human would try to help them at all
8/19/24, 10:45 PM - Aishwarya: Oh 🥹
Okay
8/19/24, 10:45 PM - Aishwarya: Ya I think so too
8/19/24, 10:46 PM - Aishwarya: On top of that ,these days,some people film such stuff 😢
Of totally unknown people 
So no reason even
8/19/24, 10:46 PM - Aishwarya: To not help is one thing
8/19/24, 10:46 PM - Aishwarya: But doing that is 😑
8/19/24, 10:47 PM - Aishwarya: Alsooo
8/19/24, 10:47 PM - Aishwarya: I hopeee
8/19/24, 10:47 PM - Aishwarya: You don't think differently of me
8/19/24, 10:47 PM - Aishwarya: Coz of this question
8/19/24, 10:47 PM - Aishwarya: Coz some people judge 

Even when they are not even a good person😑
8/19/24, 10:48 PM - Aishwarya: This one hypothetical situation
8/19/24, 10:48 PM - Aishwarya: There is one more
8/19/24, 10:49 PM - Aishwarya: That is the one I had told my Kolkata friend 
And it kinda lead to a fight 
And he told me to take my words back and tell that I will help in that situation
8/19/24, 10:51 PM - Aishwarya: <Media omitted>
8/19/24, 10:52 PM - Aishwarya: I told about that hypothetical situation on call 
And I told I won't help
8/19/24, 10:53 PM - Aishwarya: In January I think ,he got into a fight with a girl on instagram comments
8/19/24, 10:54 PM - Aishwarya: He was saying that the girls who spread rumor and hate for the animal movie deserves to be beaten up
8/19/24, 10:55 PM - Aishwarya: He is a ranbir kapoor fan
His explanation was that he don't like anyone saying bad about him 
And that it's just a movie 
I literally forgave him for that 
I actually console him saying it's okay ,you accept that you did wrong right etc
8/19/24, 10:56 PM - Aishwarya: At first I thought he was joking 
But then he had to deactivate his instagram coz some guy told that she might lodge complaint in police station
8/19/24, 10:56 PM - Aishwarya: He deleted the comments 
But the girl had screenshotted it
8/19/24, 10:56 PM - Aishwarya: He later said sorry to her
8/19/24, 10:57 PM - Aishwarya: Later he installed instagram again
8/19/24, 10:57 PM - Aishwarya: Probably he was safe and police won't do anything probably 
Even if the girl ,complained to police
8/19/24, 10:58 PM - Aishwarya: But that's not the thing
8/19/24, 10:58 PM - Aishwarya: He did all that right 
He replied to that girls comment saying girls like her who hate on animal movie should be beaten
8/19/24, 10:59 PM - Aishwarya: Some other girls had also replied to his reply 
Saying why is he saying physical assault for some minor thing
8/19/24, 11:03 PM - Sayanth: What
8/19/24, 11:04 PM - Aishwarya: That hypothetical situation was bit different 

It was just that Z and X were a couple 
Guy Z is dark skinned
Girl X is fair skinned and cute 


Then when he told me to change my words 
I added to the hypothetical situation that guy Z made fun of my skin colour even though he is dark too ( darker )
So like bullying 

Then also the Kolkata guy said that ,it is not an excuse 
You should help
8/19/24, 11:06 PM - Aishwarya: He was commenting that on instagram 
And then he got into trouble coz of that 

Then he called me to say about that 
And I had consoled him kinda 
He couldn't tell about it to his parents 
Idk if he told any irl friends about it
8/19/24, 11:06 PM - Aishwarya: Replying to a girl who commented something on the animal movie
8/19/24, 11:07 PM - Aishwarya: And there were few more comments in that thread 
Three other girls also replied against him
8/19/24, 11:09 PM - Aishwarya: <Media omitted>
8/19/24, 11:14 PM - Aishwarya: <Media omitted>
8/19/24, 11:16 PM - Aishwarya: He had actually done the wrong 
Yet I didn't judge him
8/19/24, 11:17 PM - Aishwarya: I didn't judge a bit in my mind 
But anyways I didn't even say anything 
I tried to make him feel better about the situation because he was stressed
8/19/24, 11:18 PM - Aishwarya: And I was just talking about a hypothetical situation 
He kinda got angry and asked me to change my words ,orelse he won't speak to me again
8/19/24, 11:19 PM - Aishwarya: Then I changed my words a bit 
That hypothetical situation ,the hypothetical guy Z he bullied me 
Otherwise I would help
8/19/24, 11:19 PM - Aishwarya: Then he gave some ultimatum and cut the call
8/19/24, 11:19 PM - Aishwarya: And I apologized in text
8/19/24, 11:21 PM - Aishwarya: <Media omitted>
8/19/24, 11:23 PM - Aishwarya: <Media omitted>
8/19/24, 11:23 PM - Aishwarya: But then it got solved later
8/19/24, 11:24 PM - Aishwarya: I don't necessarily have that mindset btw 
Even during that day
8/19/24, 11:25 PM - Aishwarya: It was mainly just a hypothetical situation
8/19/24, 11:25 PM - Aishwarya: But I do have a mindset like that somewhere in my mind 
Not strict about it , if that makes sense 
Even in my worst mood times if something like that actually happened  ,I might help
8/19/24, 11:26 PM - Aishwarya: It's mainly just that I wanted to say about this 🙂
8/19/24, 11:27 PM - Aishwarya: Like I want friends who understands me 
And I want them to know my negative side also
8/19/24, 11:28 PM - Aishwarya: Otherwise what happens when ,some day they have a misunderstanding because they thought of me differently 
And they cut me off coz of that 
Yk
8/19/24, 11:28 PM - Aishwarya: That's why I told all this 😊
8/19/24, 11:34 PM - Aishwarya: I wanted to tell about this few times before 
But then I thought it doesn't matter coz we won't be friends after sometime 
So no need to let you know all that 
Coz what if you cut me off instantly after knowing it🙂
8/19/24, 11:36 PM - Aishwarya: But like, it's a hypothetical situation 
And mostly I don't hold that mindset
Especially when I'm not in a bad mood
8/19/24, 11:36 PM - Aishwarya: But still just wanted to say 😊
8/19/24, 11:36 PM - Aishwarya: Good night
8/20/24, 4:53 AM - Sayanth: How do u know we won't be friends
8/20/24, 4:54 AM - Sayanth: Ahhhh I'm not leaving
8/20/24, 4:54 AM - Sayanth: You
8/20/24, 4:54 AM - Sayanth: Sorry I fell asleep again
8/20/24, 4:54 AM - Sayanth: Mid convo
8/20/24, 8:17 AM - Aishwarya: That I meant in terms of your future girlfriend asking you to limit contact to very minimum with your female friends, probably 
Such cases 
Like drifting apart I meant 
Not stopping to be friends coz of any other reasons
8/20/24, 8:18 AM - Aishwarya: Okay🥹

8/20/24, 8:19 AM - Aishwarya: It's okay

8/21/24, 9:12 PM - Aishwarya: This hypothetical situation
8/21/24, 9:12 PM - Aishwarya: Is your answer the same ?🙂
8/21/24, 9:13 PM - Aishwarya: That hypothetical situation was bit different 

It was just that Z and X were a couple 
Guy Z is dark skinned 
Girl X is fair skinned and cute
8/21/24, 9:14 PM - Aishwarya: This is the hypothetical situation 

No cheating involved 

Just a couple
8/21/24, 9:14 PM - Aishwarya: Am I obligated to help them ??
8/21/24, 9:14 PM - Sayanth: Yes it's not Y's responsibility

8/21/24, 9:15 PM - Aishwarya: Unlike that Kolkata guy for example
8/21/24, 9:18 PM - Aishwarya: Some scientist should make clones of you 🥹🥺
And then so many people have a friend like you 🥹
Especially girls
8/21/24, 9:19 PM - Sayanth: Awwww 🥺

8/21/24, 9:21 PM - Sayanth: Yeah I was gonna tell you that you don't owe anything to anyone , you can help or you cannot it's totally upto you and I don't think you are obliged to help anyone at all
8/21/24, 9:21 PM - Aishwarya: Okay🥹
8/21/24, 9:22 PM - Sayanth: See whatever you do as long as it doesn't violate someone else's freedom or rights then it's ok
8/21/24, 9:23 PM - Aishwarya: Ya
8/21/24, 9:23 PM - Aishwarya: True
8/21/24, 9:23 PM - Sayanth: I mean if u were the one who caused the accident like intentionally then yeah I'd say u are on the wrong side but that's not the case also we both know u are prolly gonna end up helping them
8/21/24, 9:24 PM - Aishwarya: Ya true 
For the first part
8/21/24, 9:24 PM - Aishwarya: Second part idk 
But you don't mind right 🙂
8/21/24, 9:24 PM - Aishwarya: https://www.reddit.com/r/Coconaad/s/WF0z2V8PL9
8/21/24, 9:25 PM - Aishwarya: I just saw this like 10 minutes ago
8/21/24, 9:25 PM - Aishwarya: This kind of things have effected my mental health soooo muchhh
8/21/24, 9:25 PM - Aishwarya: So that's were the not to help certain people kind of thoughts and feelings arise from
8/21/24, 9:25 PM - Aishwarya: You understand right 🙂
8/21/24, 9:26 PM - Sayanth: Second part too. I mean I've been talking to u for some time so I've some idea about ur character
8/21/24, 9:26 PM - Sayanth: Yeah I get it
8/21/24, 9:26 PM - Aishwarya: And these guys hold out for fair girls, only because fair girls date them 
Not all fair girls ofcourse 

So they play a role 

Their life ,their decisions 

Similarly my life ,my decisions
8/21/24, 9:27 PM - Sayanth: Yesss
8/21/24, 9:27 PM - Aishwarya: Oh 

But the things I have grudges for , it's kinda extreme hate 🙂
8/21/24, 9:27 PM - Aishwarya: Okay🥹
Thanks for being understanding
8/21/24, 9:29 PM - Aishwarya: https://www.reddit.com/r/Coconaad/s/16BPV7bQck
8/21/24, 9:29 PM - Aishwarya: And this 
Things like this
8/21/24, 9:29 PM - Sayanth: I mean if u choose not to intervene it's ok I understand. You are still my friend but if u were going to kill them as in intentionally murder someone for something silly No. like u are allowed to if that person is annoying af, or threatening you . Or ur loved ones then understandable
8/21/24, 9:30 PM - Sayanth: See I understand but it's not good for you . U realize that right
8/21/24, 9:30 PM - Aishwarya: Yea that's true 
I know I don't have the right for that ,and it's morally wrong to do 
So I'm not gonna do that ofcourse
8/21/24, 9:31 PM - Aishwarya: Ya but I think hate for being wronged is a part of finding self love 🙂

People dont have to forgive their abusers ( even if they did it not knowingly )

It has effected my mental health a lot
8/21/24, 9:31 PM - Sayanth: That's all then u are good
8/21/24, 9:31 PM - Sayanth: Yeah agreed
8/21/24, 9:32 PM - Sayanth: I'd not forgive my bullies ever

8/22/24, 10:49 PM - Sayanth: Hey I know it's difficult for you seeing these kinda things but we can't change others pov particularly when it's online. So it's better to just ignore and move on . Dear you are a good pretty human being we cannot Change their pov it's just how it is . We just can't sometimes and we gotta accept that also may be they didn't think of it as racist perhaps but we don't know their thought process I know it's difficult but sometimes ignorance is bliss it helps us to have some peace

I feel better that you are a good person who is in my life 😭🥺😢
8/23/24, 9:45 PM - Aishwarya: I wanted to talk about something else
8/23/24, 9:45 PM - Aishwarya: But I feel you will hate me after that :(😢

And that makes me more angry towards that other person 😡😭😢🥺😕
8/23/24, 9:46 PM - Sayanth: Oh ok
8/23/24, 9:46 PM - Sayanth: Go on
8/23/24, 9:46 PM - Sayanth: I'm listening

8/23/24, 9:48 PM - Aishwarya: I was crying 
I just washed my face and my anger towards her decreased 🥹
8/23/24, 9:48 PM - Sayanth: Oh
8/23/24, 9:48 PM - Sayanth: Entha sambaviche
8/23/24, 9:48 PM - Sayanth: What happened
8/23/24, 9:48 PM - Sayanth: U ok now ?
8/23/24, 9:48 PM - Aishwarya: But you know only good side of me ,that's why 😅
8/23/24, 9:48 PM - Aishwarya: Yaa
8/23/24, 9:49 PM - Aishwarya: I deleted the chats with my crush on reddit 
Will soon delete the stuff on telegram 
Whatsapp he had changed anyways
8/23/24, 9:49 PM - Sayanth: Oh ok
8/23/24, 9:49 PM - Sayanth: Go on
8/23/24, 9:50 PM - Aishwarya: Like guys don't face that much colorism 
Comparatively
8/23/24, 9:50 PM - Sayanth: See it's ok we all have some flaws no one is 100 percent pure
8/23/24, 9:52 PM - Aishwarya: My best friend in college 
She literally rejected a guy with upper middle class money 
And who is fair 
For a very dark skin guy 
He is kind of lower end of middle class financially 
But he has education so he will pick up 
But still he won't be making money like the other guy 
Plus the other guy has education too 
Plus dad's money
8/23/24, 9:53 PM - Aishwarya: Her other friend had asked out that fair guy 
The fair guy had liked my best friend first 
He had told that she and him can live a good life in their home ( like one of the things he told her )
His home looks bit palacey
8/23/24, 9:53 PM - Aishwarya: Okay 🥹
Thanks
8/23/24, 9:55 PM - Aishwarya: Later they got into relationship 

But if it was me ,I would never ask out a guy who didn't seem interested in me at first
8/23/24, 9:57 PM - Aishwarya: I checked their insta 
They are still following each other 

Idk if they are still in relationship or not 

And even if they broke up ,she had sex in relationship with that guy ( I think for some reason she really like him )
So not really a loss for her anyways imo ,even if they broke up later
8/23/24, 9:57 PM - Aishwarya: If it was me I would never pursue such a guy , coz for me to like sex ,the guy also has to actually equally like me back
8/23/24, 9:58 PM - Sayanth: Yeah understandable
8/23/24, 9:59 PM - Aishwarya: And for marriage, usually if they are not in same financial category ,it leads to break up 
Unless the girl is much better looking than the guy and it's a trade off in exchange for looks and money 
So I would never do what she did
8/23/24, 10:00 PM - Aishwarya: Plus I don't want someone whose family has way more money than me ,not because I don't want money or anything 
But because self respect comes first 
And such inequalities in money can lead to how the other party sees them 
And maybe emotional abuse also
8/23/24, 10:01 PM - Aishwarya: But her relationship was kinda validating to me
Coz she kinda looks like me
8/23/24, 10:02 PM - Aishwarya: But like my best friend in college  ,during a conversation in third year , she had told that this guy was chasing after her ,saying she and him can live in their palace 
And she didn't like him 
And she had to reject him
8/23/24, 10:04 PM - Aishwarya: Idk the way she was talking ,it felt like she is some big shot
8/23/24, 10:04 PM - Aishwarya: In the sense superior to that other girl
8/23/24, 10:04 PM - Aishwarya: And that her ex was too much chasing after her
8/23/24, 10:05 PM - Aishwarya: I don't know if it's true though 
I just know that he proposed her 
Idk if she was exaggerating how much he chased her
8/23/24, 10:06 PM - Aishwarya: That guy don't have to chase after anyone imo
8/23/24, 10:06 PM - Sayanth: Oh ok
8/23/24, 10:06 PM - Aishwarya: And this girl and my best friend 
The only thing my best friend had more than her ,was the fair skin 
Which is important ofcourse, especially for girls
8/23/24, 10:08 PM - Aishwarya: Like both the girls had equally attractive face and bodies otherwise 
And money wise also kinda similar 
But for some reason this girls home looked better than my best friends
And that girl used to spend more money on everything in general
8/23/24, 10:08 PM - Aishwarya: So like just the fair skin is the thing she has more this other girl
8/23/24, 10:09 PM - Aishwarya: And she was thinking and saying stuff as if she is superior to that girl
8/23/24, 10:10 PM - Aishwarya: Especially coz that guy had proposed my best friend 
And this girl is the one to propose him
8/23/24, 10:10 PM - Aishwarya: But if the other girl was fair, she would have proposed her too 
Coz apart from the fair skin ,both girls are the same
8/23/24, 10:12 PM - Aishwarya: So like this used best friend girl ,she thinks she is better than this other girl ,coz of her fair skin 

Then stick to the fair guys bitch 😭🥺
Like wtf 
I reallyyyy hate this kinda girls 

It makes life more tough for the dark skin girls 
Coz such girls are making the dark skin guys also chase after the fair girls
8/23/24, 10:14 PM - Aishwarya: Also ,it's not like dark skin girls don't like fair guys more than dark skin guys 
Even if not for the physical attractiveness , the dark skin girls would also ( probably) like fair guys for the genes for the kids 
Coz having fair skin is a privilege
8/23/24, 10:15 PM - Aishwarya: But like dark skin girls always go for dark skin guys 
Why because 
1)they don't have a chance with fair guys 
2)Plus girls usually fall for vibes etc than the looks 
And also there are many girls who feel uncomfortable if the guy is or thinks he looks better than her
8/23/24, 10:17 PM - Aishwarya: And girls don't like a guy who thinks he looks better than her ( generally )
8/23/24, 10:17 PM - Aishwarya: To be in a relationship with
8/23/24, 10:18 PM - Sayanth: Ok
8/23/24, 10:18 PM - Sayanth: Go on
8/23/24, 10:18 PM - Aishwarya: And girls don't like a guy who society thinks is better looking than her
8/23/24, 10:19 PM - Aishwarya: Most people ( both genders looks average only)
So adding fair skin means ,and if the guy is the fair skin one, then he is the better looking one in the relationship 
So dark skin girls are almost always paired with dark skin guys only
8/23/24, 10:20 PM - Aishwarya: That and all is okay 
Coz there is enough good enough dark skin guys too
(for whatever brown skin range the girl is )
There is guy that skin tone or less 
There is enough guys like that to date
8/23/24, 10:22 PM - Aishwarya: But the problem is some of these fair skin girls either feel bad for dark guys who has insecurities due to their skin color a life 
Plus lot of girls like guys who are not too dark anyways 
( like the girls don't really care that much about the guy's skin tone )
8/23/24, 10:24 PM - Aishwarya: Another reason is some of the fair skin girls are attention whores 

Like a fair skin girl won't get that much attention from a fair guy , like the attention she will get from a dark skin or brown skin toned guy
8/23/24, 10:24 PM - Aishwarya: Coz the fair guy is fair too
8/23/24, 10:25 PM - Aishwarya: But like in my best friend's case ,that fair guy was giving her more attention than the dark skin guy even
8/23/24, 10:27 PM - Aishwarya: My best friend told that her boyfriend didn't really officially propose to her 
Like they just knew they liked each other and mutually got into a relationship
8/23/24, 10:29 PM - Aishwarya: Then whytf she chose that dark skin guy ?😭

Who will the dark skin girls date then
8/23/24, 10:30 PM - Aishwarya: And what makes me more mad is that I had complimented this dark skin guy 😭( before they got into relationship and before I know they both like each other etc it was )
8/23/24, 10:31 PM - Aishwarya: I had called him an item 😭

Idk I just thought it was a cool thing to say 

Like I don't think he heard it though 
I had told to my roommates 💀
8/23/24, 10:31 PM - Aishwarya: And like in third year ,this dark skin guy commented on my looks 
He said that I look like a clown in makeup
8/23/24, 10:32 PM - Sayanth: Tf
8/23/24, 10:32 PM - Aishwarya: And I know that I look kinda nice in makeup 
I have some proofs for it
8/23/24, 10:32 PM - Sayanth: Dude u look gorgeous even without make up
8/23/24, 10:32 PM - Aishwarya: Okay 😭🥹
8/23/24, 10:34 PM - Aishwarya: Like this guy had the audacity to say that because he dated a fair skin pretty girl like my best friend
8/23/24, 10:35 PM - Aishwarya: And one other girl ( she is kinda promiscuous) ,she had asked them for a threesome 

That girl is fair and attractive too <This message was edited>
8/23/24, 10:36 PM - Aishwarya: This girl's ex boyfriend was dark too 
But not as dark as my best friend's ex
8/23/24, 10:37 PM - Aishwarya: Her later bf was fair
8/23/24, 10:38 PM - Aishwarya: That other dark guy was the one who didn't like it when someone shipped me and him 

Coz now that he dated a fair girl 
He thinks that is what he deserves now 

He had proposed another fair girl 
But she rejected him 
And that girl later got into a relationship with a guy who is dark like him ,but who is fat also 😭
Like not overweight ,fattt
8/23/24, 10:41 PM - Sayanth: Oh ok got it
8/23/24, 10:42 PM - Aishwarya: So like after my crush posted that ,I was feeling sad and kinda depressed on and off
8/23/24, 10:45 PM - Aishwarya: It's like I can't even like a fair guy 😭 without having my self respect torn into pieces 

Meanwhile the dark skin guys chase after fair girls and date them ,have sex with them whatever 
If not they date dark skin girls ( dark skin girls who don't have eyes have fair guys ,coz probably no chance )
Plus in general girls in relationship like that guy only 
Idk
8/23/24, 10:45 PM - Aishwarya: In the sense girls can like other guys ,but only if they are giving them attention atleast for example
8/23/24, 10:46 PM - Aishwarya: While in relationship it's forbidden especially for girls to be having that kinda interaction with guys
8/23/24, 10:46 PM - Aishwarya: And only in fair girls case ,guys hit on the girl even while they are in relationship
8/23/24, 10:46 PM - Aishwarya: My best friend told that many guys used to hit on her even while she was in relationship
8/23/24, 10:47 PM - Aishwarya: Like one senior guy gave her chocolate in public 
She accepted that and her boyfriend threw it away lol
8/23/24, 10:48 PM - Aishwarya: Also this used to best friend girl ,got cheated on though 
That too he cheated on her with another girl in class too
8/23/24, 10:49 PM - Aishwarya: She's not special 
Attractive yes
8/23/24, 10:49 PM - Sayanth: So much drama
8/23/24, 10:51 PM - Aishwarya: Ya💀
I feel like that girl just wanted the thrill of ruining a relationship 
My best friend was beautiful, smart etc ,liked by others etc 

That cheater girl had many single better looking guys hitting on her 
No need to cheat with that guy 
Plus idk if anything physical happened, I feel no 
It was sexting and stuff 
But she had some doubt that he cheated physically with another girl ( outside of our college )
8/23/24, 10:53 PM - Aishwarya: I had asked if my last two crushes hit on her too 
She said no
8/23/24, 10:54 PM - Aishwarya: But like my third crush ,he is autistic 
He don't really have conversational skills 
Without making it awkward
8/23/24, 10:54 PM - Aishwarya: But like the second crush didn't hit on her too ,probably coz she is in a relationship 
That's good
8/23/24, 10:55 PM - Aishwarya: In the sense ,i feel like if there was a guy who i liked ,and if he hit on her ,she will tell it to others ,to get validation
8/23/24, 10:56 PM - Aishwarya: Coz she did the same with her other friend
8/23/24, 10:58 PM - Aishwarya: Oh and during a train travel , the train stopped at a station for a long time 
And there were some IT guys near the train door of outside 
But I didn't really look at them 

I was like later kinda looking at one girl ,she looked kinda nice 
Like just simply looking ,not staring
8/23/24, 10:58 PM - Sayanth: Sounds like me
8/23/24, 10:58 PM - Aishwarya: Later she and her bf shifted to seat in front me 

There were a lot of empty seats 
Idk why she came there 😭
She was seated somewhere else before
8/23/24, 10:59 PM - Sayanth: 🌚
8/23/24, 10:59 PM - Aishwarya: Oh okay 
But I think in your case you can develop it with practise and more confidence 
Good luck 😊
8/23/24, 10:59 PM - Sayanth: Yeah understandable how it feels when u are single
8/23/24, 10:59 PM - Sayanth: Have been through that a lot
8/23/24, 10:59 PM - Aishwarya: And she and him was doing too much PDA ( physical display of affection)😭
8/23/24, 11:00 PM - Sayanth: 🥲
8/23/24, 11:00 PM - Aishwarya: She was fair and he was dark 
Like much darker than me
8/23/24, 11:00 PM - Aishwarya: Oh
8/23/24, 11:01 PM - Aishwarya: And then I took my sunscreen ( the sunscreen looks like a fairness cream before it blends right )
So I put it twice in a time period of one hour 💀
To make it extra
8/23/24, 11:02 PM - Aishwarya: Idk she triggered my skin colour insecurity
8/23/24, 11:02 PM - Aishwarya: So had to do some pay back
8/23/24, 11:02 PM - Sayanth: Whaaat did u do
8/23/24, 11:02 PM - Sayanth: ☠️
8/23/24, 11:02 PM - Aishwarya: But idk if they understood what I meant 💀
8/23/24, 11:02 PM - Aishwarya: Like just applying the cream 😅
8/23/24, 11:02 PM - Aishwarya: Twice
8/23/24, 11:02 PM - Sayanth: Well u gotta get rid of that
8/23/24, 11:03 PM - Sayanth: Infront of them
8/23/24, 11:03 PM - Aishwarya: Ya🥺🥹
8/23/24, 11:03 PM - Sayanth: 🙄
8/23/24, 11:03 PM - Sayanth: See u are pretty
8/23/24, 11:03 PM - Aishwarya: Yaa they were in my front seat
8/23/24, 11:03 PM - Sayanth: Not just average or anything but prolly a 9 or above that
8/23/24, 11:03 PM - Sayanth: It's just you are insecure af
8/23/24, 11:03 PM - Aishwarya: I meant it like as him needing fairness cream too 😅
He is very dark
8/23/24, 11:03 PM - Aishwarya: By applying sunscreen
8/23/24, 11:04 PM - Aishwarya: Nooo🥹
But thanks
8/23/24, 11:04 PM - Aishwarya: Ya
8/23/24, 11:04 PM - Sayanth: You are like really pretty but for some reason u can't accept it which is understandable from what u said about ur experiences
8/23/24, 11:04 PM - Sayanth: Yessss
8/23/24, 11:05 PM - Sayanth: U gotta start accepting that u are pretty
8/23/24, 11:05 PM - Sayanth: Also why do u really think fair guys won't fall for u ?
8/23/24, 11:06 PM - Aishwarya: Like actually thanks 
It means you care about me 

Yk I remember a guy who was out of the blue mentioning his physical preference as fair
Like what was the need 😭💀
Like everyone knows that guys like fair girls the most
And like lighter skin tones are universally seen as more attractive ( even though in some parts its not that much )
8/23/24, 11:06 PM - Aishwarya: Yaa🙂
8/23/24, 11:06 PM - Aishwarya: Okay 🥹
8/23/24, 11:07 PM - Aishwarya: Idk 
I hope so 😭
8/23/24, 11:07 PM - Aishwarya: Yesterday I had DMd a guy about something
Like his fair friend is dating a dark skin girl since a year
8/23/24, 11:07 PM - Aishwarya: 💀
8/23/24, 11:08 PM - Aishwarya: And I asked for that guys contact ,to make him my new crush 🥹💀
8/23/24, 11:08 PM - Sayanth: I mean may be its just I'm ignorant but from my pov I've never looked at someone's skin tone . And all of my crushs have been darker skin toned ones
8/23/24, 11:08 PM - Sayanth: No
8/23/24, 11:08 PM - Sayanth: Don't do that
8/23/24, 11:09 PM - Aishwarya: <Media omitted>
8/23/24, 11:09 PM - Sayanth: I need you to do some things
8/23/24, 11:09 PM - Aishwarya: Oh what's that
8/23/24, 11:09 PM - Aishwarya: Installing dating app ?
8/23/24, 11:10 PM - Sayanth: Yeah that too
8/23/24, 11:10 PM - Aishwarya: Like this guy is a certified guy
8/23/24, 11:10 PM - Sayanth: But not now
8/23/24, 11:10 PM - Aishwarya: Since he dated this girl for a year 
So it helps with my confidence
8/23/24, 11:10 PM - Aishwarya: Ya true
8/23/24, 11:10 PM - Aishwarya: And it helps with my emotions too
8/23/24, 11:11 PM - Aishwarya: Yesterday I was having so much rage
8/23/24, 11:11 PM - Aishwarya: After I felt betrayed by my crush
8/23/24, 11:11 PM - Aishwarya: After he posted that kinda racist reel
8/23/24, 11:11 PM - Aishwarya: And my rage was mostly directed towards dark skin guys and fair skin girls 
Coz in my mind they are the reason for my insecurities
8/23/24, 11:12 PM - Sayanth: See
8/23/24, 11:13 PM - Sayanth: We gotta get rid of ur insecurities ok
8/23/24, 11:13 PM - Sayanth: We gotta work on them
8/23/24, 11:13 PM - Aishwarya: My best friends ex boyfriend he was one of them who my rage was directed towards 
If I tell what it is ,you might hate me 😭
8/23/24, 11:13 PM - Aishwarya: Yaa true 🥺
8/23/24, 11:13 PM - Aishwarya: Ya
8/23/24, 11:14 PM - Aishwarya: And I got more mad at them that even my friends will hate for what they turnt me into
8/23/24, 11:14 PM - Aishwarya: But like those are just thoughts
8/23/24, 11:14 PM - Aishwarya: Also it's only when I'm in my lowest of moods 
Yesterday was one such day 
Coz my crush posted a racist reel
8/23/24, 11:15 PM - Aishwarya: I kinda attached to him
8/23/24, 11:15 PM - Aishwarya: For him to, most possibly, not like me as much as fair pretty girls is one thing
8/23/24, 11:16 PM - Aishwarya: But like posting a colorist reel 😭
I feel so many emotions 
And was feeling very low 😢
8/23/24, 11:17 PM - Aishwarya: Should I tell or not tell ?🙂

I think I want to know if it's normal to feel like that ,after feeling so much betrayal 🥺
8/23/24, 11:18 PM - Aishwarya: I think you probably got the idea 😭
8/23/24, 11:18 PM - Sayanth: U should
8/23/24, 11:18 PM - Aishwarya: Oh
8/23/24, 11:18 PM - Aishwarya: It's like
8/23/24, 11:19 PM - Sayanth: See I won't hate u no matter what but we gotta work on ur insecurities
8/23/24, 11:19 PM - Sayanth: Ok ? I want u to tell me that you'd
8/23/24, 11:21 PM - Aishwarya: Cutting off the head with a sword 🙂blood coming out 

And also horizontally cutting off the body ,in parallel cuts 
It's just a visual 
Not possible in real coz bones exist 

Like when I close my eyes to sleep, I visualize that as my revenge 
But it's not automatic 
I consciously think it coz it helps me calm down a bit 
And I stopped crying
8/23/24, 11:21 PM - Aishwarya: Okay 🙂
8/23/24, 11:22 PM - Aishwarya: Ya 😊I will try 
But it's not easy 
Coz of past experiences 

But I will try
8/23/24, 11:22 PM - Sayanth: Ik it's not easy but I'm not giving up on u
8/23/24, 11:23 PM - Sayanth: I want u to be secure about urself
8/23/24, 11:23 PM - Aishwarya: Okay🥹😊
8/23/24, 11:23 PM - Aishwarya: Okay 😇
8/23/24, 11:23 PM - Aishwarya: You have helped me reduce my hate for others 🙂
8/23/24, 11:23 PM - Sayanth: Idk if it's normal but I kinda use to do the same
8/23/24, 11:23 PM - Sayanth: So dw
8/23/24, 11:24 PM - Sayanth: 🫥
8/23/24, 11:24 PM - Aishwarya: I felt like most people in the world are against me ,trying to put me down, for their satisfaction and to feel better about themselves
8/23/24, 11:25 PM - Aishwarya: Okay 🥹
8/23/24, 11:25 PM - Aishwarya: Okay 😂
Idk if it's true but thanks 🙂🥹
8/23/24, 11:26 PM - Sayanth: It is
8/23/24, 11:26 PM - Sayanth: And dw cuz I imagine worse than that
8/23/24, 11:26 PM - Aishwarya: Oh I feel like then it might be common 
Unless it's related to your bpd 
But like bpd stems from trauma mostly right 
These days who doesn't go through trauma
8/23/24, 11:27 PM - Aishwarya: Oh okay 😂
8/23/24, 11:28 PM - Aishwarya: It might be common and people might not be telling it 


My one therapist called me a sadist 
As if she haven't felt any extreme grudges towards anyone 
But like one friend one mine told that it's very unprofessional of her to say like that
8/23/24, 11:29 PM - Aishwarya: First of all she didn't even think about a therapist saying such words would have on someone 

But I don't value her ,so i didn't value her words 
Apart from the initial anger I felt
8/23/24, 11:30 PM - Aishwarya: Like mentally destroying someone is cruel too 

Knowingly or unknowingly
8/23/24, 11:30 PM - Sayanth: What the fukkk
8/23/24, 11:32 PM - Aishwarya: And then I told her that I'm good towards good people 

My bullies harmed people who didn't harm them 
So my negative feelings towards them are valid 

Except maybe some cases ,like my best friend 
But I didn't tell about my best friend to her though
8/23/24, 11:32 PM - Aishwarya: Yaaa🙂😓
8/23/24, 11:33 PM - Aishwarya: The people who I told her were the ones who clearly tried to harm me by their words 

There is no misunderstanding type of stuff there
8/23/24, 11:33 PM - Sayanth: U are a sadist only if ur finding pleasure from hurting others
8/23/24, 11:34 PM - Aishwarya: And I had told her that I had stopped taking sessions with my previous therapist because she asked me if I wanted to reconcile with my dad 
And because she said that my dad has improved ,so try to see the positive side of him
8/23/24, 11:35 PM - Aishwarya: Like I can understand why the first therapist said that 

But it was invalidating
8/23/24, 11:36 PM - Aishwarya: But like this second therapist ( who called me sadist) ,she repeated the same ( what I said I didn't like about the first therapist)
8/23/24, 11:37 PM - Aishwarya: So I feel she was not a good therapist 
So her words are also invalid 
But I did get angry though 

I wanted to say something back to her for calling me sadist 
But I didn't
8/23/24, 11:38 PM - Aishwarya: Yaa 
Only if someone is finding pleasure from hurting innocent people ,they are sadist
8/23/24, 11:39 PM - Aishwarya: Idk its validating that you said so 🥹
Thanks 😅
8/23/24, 11:40 PM - Aishwarya: Likee
8/23/24, 11:40 PM - Aishwarya: If you sometimes or even rarely feel so
8/23/24, 11:40 PM - Aishwarya: Then it's definitely not that uncommon
8/23/24, 11:40 PM - Aishwarya: Atleast in guys 
Because testosterone etc I guess
8/23/24, 11:40 PM - Aishwarya: But probably in girls too
8/23/24, 11:40 PM - Aishwarya: Anyways
8/23/24, 11:40 PM - Aishwarya: Not uncommon 🥹
8/23/24, 11:41 PM - Aishwarya: And like from what all I know about you
8/23/24, 11:41 PM - Aishwarya: You are the best character person I know from india, yet
8/23/24, 11:42 PM - Aishwarya: So it's validating 🥹
8/23/24, 11:42 PM - Aishwarya: I feel normal now 🥹
8/23/24, 11:42 PM - Aishwarya: I mean before also I felt normal only 
But some small doubt
8/23/24, 11:43 PM - Aishwarya: Also like I said, after I washed my face ,suddenly the crying and rage stopped
8/23/24, 11:43 PM - Aishwarya: Due to that I was deleting the chats with my crush
8/23/24, 11:48 PM - Aishwarya: It can feel not believable probably, idk 

I had told that to someone else before and he said what kind of worse people have you met to say like that
8/23/24, 11:48 PM - Aishwarya: Also I just hope you still see me as the same friend 😭🥹
8/23/24, 11:49 PM - Sayanth: I do
8/23/24, 11:49 PM - Sayanth: Told you I won't hate u
8/23/24, 11:49 PM - Aishwarya: Okay then 🥹
Thanks 
That means a lot
8/23/24, 11:49 PM - Aishwarya: Okay 🥹
8/23/24, 11:50 PM - Sayanth: Also jam?
8/23/24, 11:50 PM - Aishwarya: I think I have told almost everything 💀
Probably just like two more things left 
But that's like way less bad that what I already said
8/23/24, 11:50 PM - Aishwarya: So I'm safe
8/23/24, 11:50 PM - Aishwarya: That you won't hate me at some point
8/23/24, 11:50 PM - Sayanth: Yes u are
8/23/24, 11:51 PM - Aishwarya: Yaa
8/23/24, 11:51 PM - Sayanth: I won't

So should be tasty right
8/24/24, 10:28 PM - Aishwarya: Comfort food is non veg sadya and sadya
In my mind its not so unhealthy comparatively 
Idk why

8/24/24, 10:32 PM - Aishwarya: Vijay devarakonda in one interview I saw on youtube shorts said its not unhealthy 
Coz it's chicken and rice 
The interviewer said something when he said that he eats biriyani for lunch
8/24/24, 10:32 PM - Aishwarya: Nothing
8/24/24, 10:32 PM - Aishwarya: Wbu ?

8/24/24, 10:39 PM - Aishwarya: Yaa it is not
8/24/24, 10:39 PM - Sayanth: At least it's healthier than normal Sadhya
8/24/24, 10:39 PM - Aishwarya: Just some of the hotels biriyani is unhealthy 
Coz too much oil 
Or butter
8/24/24, 10:40 PM - Aishwarya: Imo noo
With less rice and no payasam ,sadya is healthier than biriyani
8/24/24, 10:40 PM - Aishwarya: Coz veggies is there ,and no oil in the rice
8/24/24, 10:41 PM - Sayanth: Yesss
8/24/24, 10:42 PM - Sayanth: But no meat
8/24/24, 10:42 PM - Sayanth: Thus less protein
8/24/24, 10:42 PM - Aishwarya: Non veg sadya
8/24/24, 10:42 PM - Sayanth: Also usually we take Salad as side dish
8/24/24, 10:42 PM - Sayanth: Eeeeh

8/24/24, 10:43 PM - Aishwarya: Ya that's true 😅
8/24/24, 10:43 PM - Aishwarya: Hm
8/24/24, 10:45 PM - Aishwarya: Oh but there is something
8/24/24, 10:45 PM - Aishwarya: Like non veg foods there is more chance of getting food poisoning
8/24/24, 10:45 PM - Sayanth: But yeah in that case tru
8/24/24, 10:45 PM - Aishwarya: From hotels
8/24/24, 10:45 PM - Aishwarya: Yaaaa

8/24/24, 11:00 PM - Aishwarya: It's taste is kinda nice ,not much 
But not good enough for the amount of calories it has :(

Some people eat it like it's some sauce 😂
8/24/24, 11:00 PM - Aishwarya: Yaa
8/24/24, 11:00 PM - Sayanth: Yess

8/26/24, 12:39 AM - Aishwarya: Ya true 
But still 😓
8/26/24, 12:41 AM - Sayanth: Correction the correct term is venomous cuz the organism has to inject the toxin to our body to harm us
8/26/24, 12:41 AM - Aishwarya: Ya true
8/26/24, 12:41 AM - Aishwarya: 😬😂
8/26/24, 12:41 AM - Sayanth: Poison can be affected through touch or ingestion too
8/26/24, 12:41 AM - Aishwarya: True
8/26/24, 12:41 AM - Sayanth: 😭😭😭

8/26/24, 12:46 AM - Aishwarya: True
8/26/24, 12:47 AM - Aishwarya: Anyways venomous is more correct
8/26/24, 12:48 AM - Sayanth: As far as I know spiders inject their venom through their fangs
8/26/24, 12:48 AM - Aishwarya: Ya
8/26/24, 12:49 AM - Sayanth: <Media omitted>

9/1/24, 10:00 PM - Aishwarya: Since few days he called me to talk about somethings

9/1/24, 10:01 PM - Sayanth: ok
9/1/24, 10:01 PM - Sayanth: go on
9/1/24, 10:02 PM - Aishwarya: Some minutes ago he called me to say that his ex called and he declined the call 
And asked if to call back or no

9/1/24, 10:06 PM - Aishwarya: Likee I remember longgg ago( in february, i think ; i had met him in dec), when he send me a pic of his ex 
I felt like a bit jealous 😅😭💀
Coz she was very pretty 
Prettier than I expected
9/1/24, 10:06 PM - Aishwarya: But rn I felt nothing like that 
In fact I was bit positive I guess
9/1/24, 10:07 PM - Aishwarya: Like just me monitoring my emotions 💀😅
9/1/24, 10:08 PM - Aishwarya: Like I always knew that I don't have crush on him or like him etc 
Despite him being cute etc
9/1/24, 10:09 PM - Aishwarya: Coz he is better than me imo  , in some things 
Probably one of the reasons 
Plus I told right he is 23
9/1/24, 10:10 PM - Aishwarya: Oh and
9/1/24, 10:13 PM - Aishwarya: I used to like speak to him on call for like 30 minutes to 1 hour like that 
Every other day 
Then later it got decreased 
But I used to call him when I wanted to talk about something ,coz he told I can call him 
He told ,just ask him if he is free in whatsapp ( coz I asked him many times if I will be disturbing him )
9/1/24, 10:15 PM - Aishwarya: Ideally I want a friend who is a girl 🥹but I have to like her character 
Plus other things
9/1/24, 10:18 PM - Aishwarya: Idk I just wish I had friend who I can call also 
But who is a good human also

9/8/24, 10:06 PM - Sayanth: Yeah
9/8/24, 10:07 PM - Aishwarya: Okay

Opposites attract sometimes

9/8/24, 10:07 PM - Sayanth: She sent me her full nude
9/8/24, 10:08 PM - Sayanth: Then just left
9/8/24, 10:08 PM - Sayanth: Idk how to feel about this
9/8/24, 10:08 PM - Aishwarya: Oh like with face ?
To a stranger 
Then most probably it's not a girl 😭
9/8/24, 10:08 PM - Sayanth: No
9/8/24, 10:08 PM - Sayanth: Not with face
9/8/24, 10:08 PM - Aishwarya: Damn I was shipping you both 😭
9/8/24, 10:08 PM - Sayanth: From neck thighs
9/8/24, 10:08 PM - Aishwarya: Oh okay

9/8/24, 10:08 PM - Aishwarya: Okay

9/8/24, 10:12 PM - Aishwarya: And clear the papers soon

9/8/24, 10:13 PM - Aishwarya: That's okay 
If she likes you ,most probably she wouldn't find so called cringe replied cringe

9/8/24, 10:13 PM - Aishwarya: Yaa

9/8/24, 10:14 PM - Sayanth: No way she'd like me tho
9/8/24, 10:14 PM - Aishwarya: And alsoo
Don't get into relationship too soon with anyone
Coz then I probably won't be able to talk to you 
Your girlfriend might have relationship rules right, idk
9/8/24, 10:15 PM - Aishwarya: Okay 
Yea things can happen fast
9/8/24, 10:16 PM - Aishwarya: Except the she a girl part ,that maybe fake , especially coz it's reddit 

If it's she ,she probably liked you 
Why would she lie about it
9/8/24, 10:17 PM - Sayanth: I'm not gonna leave u
9/8/24, 10:17 PM - Sayanth: No matter what
9/8/24, 10:17 PM - Aishwarya: Okayy🥹

9/8/24, 10:17 PM - Sayanth: Ik sounds lame but I don't want u to leave me
9/8/24, 10:17 PM - Aishwarya: Ya
9/8/24, 10:17 PM - Aishwarya: What
9/8/24, 10:18 PM - Aishwarya: Really 
Thanks 
Good for me
9/8/24, 10:19 PM - Aishwarya: I won't leave you especially good friends are not easy to find 
The few friends I have now is from many others 
I didn't like the others
9/8/24, 10:19 PM - Aishwarya: And in that few friends you are my favorite friend currently
9/8/24, 10:20 PM - Aishwarya: Rarely i feel to find some new friends 
Like one or two
9/8/24, 10:20 PM - Aishwarya: But then I remember how much effort and time to find
9/8/24, 10:21 PM - Aishwarya: And luck
9/8/24, 10:22 PM - Aishwarya: Plus they have to be in similar time zones
9/8/24, 10:25 PM - Aishwarya: The girls , some of them have competition mindset 
It's annoying 
I have three girl friends who are not like that 
But they are kinda buzy
9/8/24, 10:25 PM - Aishwarya: And the guys , the misogyny that many of them have 
Makes them not friend material
9/8/24, 10:26 PM - Aishwarya: And also it get complicated if they like me or I like them 
Things like that
9/8/24, 10:27 PM - Aishwarya: But I don't like my guy friends like that 
Even if I do ,I know it will ruin the friendship etc 
So I never go there 
I just have few good friends
9/8/24, 10:29 PM - Aishwarya: Like one guy ,he stopped talking to me coz he liked me and I didn't like him back 
But I understood his pov though
9/8/24, 10:30 PM - Aishwarya: My kolkata friend he don't like me in more than a friend way ( this is the case with guys better looking than me )
9/8/24, 10:32 PM - Aishwarya: I have two more guy friends like that 
But the others are not from india 
So we are not much in contact 
Except every week checkups etc
9/8/24, 10:32 PM - Aishwarya: In that one guy is very nice 
He has a gf 
Like he got the gf later
9/8/24, 10:33 PM - Aishwarya: You are also nice like him 
And a guy 
Which is not common 
Idk why
9/8/24, 10:33 PM - Aishwarya: And you are from india 
That too from kerala 🥳
9/8/24, 10:34 PM - Sayanth: I'm not gonna leave u no matter what so dw
9/8/24, 10:35 PM - Aishwarya: Okay🥹🥳

9/8/24, 11:01 PM - Sayanth: <Media omitted>

9/8/24, 11:04 PM - Sayanth: Didn't take anything else just this
9/8/24, 11:04 PM - Aishwarya: Oh okay
9/8/24, 11:05 PM - Sayanth: <Media omitted>
9/8/24, 11:05 PM - Aishwarya: Oh 😂
9/8/24, 11:05 PM - Aishwarya: But looks cute though
9/8/24, 11:06 PM - Aishwarya: Ohh also 
I know a guy who is autistic 
He's so cute
9/8/24, 11:07 PM - Aishwarya: Unrelated ,but just said coz I don't want to be not respectful to the community
9/8/24, 11:07 PM - Sayanth: Yeah they tend to be cuter
9/8/24, 11:08 PM - Sayanth: I'm totally a different person with and without beard
9/8/24, 11:08 PM - Aishwarya: Ohh 
That idk 
I have read some reddit posts on ugly subreddit 
The guys who are autistic and ugly🥺
Like I haven't seen them though 
But just their posts
9/8/24, 11:09 PM - Aishwarya: I used to read alot on autism 
When I used to like him 
Idk just found it interesting
9/8/24, 11:09 PM - Aishwarya: Oh and one of my favorite youtuber ,she told she was diagnosed with autism 
But she has the overconfident persona 
Idk
9/8/24, 11:10 PM - Aishwarya: Like the instagram baddie look and personality I mean
9/8/24, 11:10 PM - Aishwarya: Yaaa
9/8/24, 11:10 PM - Sayanth: Oh
9/8/24, 11:10 PM - Aishwarya: https://www.instagram.com/anncytwinkle?igsh=ZzRqdnMwNWlzYms=
9/8/24, 11:10 PM - Aishwarya: This girl
9/8/24, 11:11 PM - Aishwarya: But you look so cute in both 🥹
Atleast in pics it's like that
9/8/24, 11:12 PM - Aishwarya: You look so adorable without the beard
9/8/24, 11:12 PM - Aishwarya: With beard a different look 
But that's also good
9/8/24, 11:20 PM - Aishwarya: I think most guys look bit better with the beard 
Probably that's why
9/8/24, 11:36 PM - Aishwarya: But some girls have different opinions btw 
My crush's ex preferred no beard look on him 
But I think he looks much better with beard 
Similarly I saw his friends saying the same in a group
9/8/24, 11:38 PM - Aishwarya: But you look cute in both
Without beard you have this adorable kind of look 
And maybe like more pavam 
Idk 🥹😂
Like a cat or baby 
Bit innocent 
So many stereotypes lol

9/9/24, 7:12 PM - Sayanth: Yup

9/9/24, 7:13 PM - Aishwarya: Ohh 🥹
9/9/24, 7:13 PM - Aishwarya: Nice 🥹
9/9/24, 7:13 PM - Aishwarya: Oh but why
9/9/24, 7:13 PM - Aishwarya: Junior girl btw 
Is she very intelligent 
Any reason like that ?
Or just simply
9/9/24, 7:14 PM - Aishwarya: Or just more people management skills
9/9/24, 7:14 PM - Aishwarya: Coz of that she is leader
9/9/24, 7:14 PM - Aishwarya: Sorry for the doubts 😅
9/9/24, 7:15 PM - Sayanth: Idk it's just well she's 3rd year she got more time so um we thought it'd be better if she handled things
9/9/24, 7:15 PM - Aishwarya: Ohh yaa 
Okay got it
9/9/24, 7:15 PM - Sayanth: Also it'd give her more experience
9/9/24, 7:16 PM - Aishwarya: Yaa you seem very into this
So I was curious why you were not the leader 
And if she is more intelligent or something
9/9/24, 7:16 PM - Aishwarya: Yaa
Got it now
9/9/24, 7:16 PM - Sayanth: Well she's technical better than me at this point
9/9/24, 7:16 PM - Sayanth: Academically at least
9/9/24, 7:16 PM - Aishwarya: Ohh okay
9/9/24, 7:17 PM - Sayanth: She's got like 9.3 something CGPA
9/9/24, 7:17 PM - Aishwarya: Okay 
Good for the girl representation
9/9/24, 7:17 PM - Aishwarya: Ohhh nicee 🥹🥹
9/9/24, 7:18 PM - Aishwarya: What about this team ?
Any idea
9/9/24, 7:18 PM - Aishwarya: Who is leader ?
Who is better at academics etc
9/9/24, 7:18 PM - Aishwarya: Like more better ,comparatively
9/9/24, 7:18 PM - Sayanth: I mean STEM field is topped by girls rn
9/9/24, 7:18 PM - Aishwarya: Ofcourse all are good 
That's why they in this right
9/9/24, 7:19 PM - Sayanth: Academically it's obviously gonna be girls
9/9/24, 7:19 PM - Aishwarya: Ohh🥹
Okay
9/9/24, 7:19 PM - Sayanth: But idk about who's the leader
9/9/24, 7:19 PM - Aishwarya: Yaaa that's true 
But what about the practical visee
9/9/24, 7:19 PM - Aishwarya: Okay
9/9/24, 7:20 PM - Sayanth: Usually it's boys for some reason
9/9/24, 7:20 PM - Aishwarya: Like my brother was not thatt good at academics 
But he likes his work and he seems to be good at it 
Like there is some stereotype that the guys are better in the practical side 
Like the applied knowledge
9/9/24, 7:20 PM - Sayanth: Like girls are better at theories and boys are better at practicals idk why at least in my class that's how it is
9/9/24, 7:20 PM - Aishwarya: I see 
Okay
9/9/24, 7:21 PM - Sayanth: Yesss I used to think it's just some stereotype but now that I got in college I'm seeing this firsthand
9/9/24, 7:21 PM - Aishwarya: Ohh 
Seems to be like that in many places 
Don't know why
9/9/24, 7:21 PM - Aishwarya: Yaa
9/9/24, 7:21 PM - Aishwarya: True
9/9/24, 7:23 PM - Sayanth: Yess exactly my mom too . She's so good at mathematics well that's her masters so makes sense. But still she's good at theory. But when it comes to practicals she's not that good. It's almost like she wouldn't use her theoretical knowledge to do practical things
9/9/24, 7:24 PM - Aishwarya: Another green flag of you 🥹
You seem to have appreciation for the girl 
Idk if that's the word
9/9/24, 7:24 PM - Aishwarya: Yaa
9/9/24, 7:25 PM - Aishwarya: I wonder what's the reason for the pattern
9/9/24, 7:25 PM - Aishwarya: Likeeee
Based on some guys I know I mean 
Ofcourse there are good guys too 🥹
9/9/24, 7:26 PM - Aishwarya: Plus my dad and bro also 😅
9/9/24, 7:27 PM - Aishwarya: I mean when somebody asks 
How we describe another person
9/9/24, 7:28 PM - Sayanth: Ik this sounds sexist but this is soo true even the topper girls don't do well in practicals there are exceptions. But in general it's like that. And even the academically worse guys will be somewhat good at practicals for some reason. Again there are exceptions.
9/9/24, 7:28 PM - Aishwarya: Yaa true that
9/9/24, 7:28 PM - Sayanth: Yeah
9/9/24, 7:28 PM - Aishwarya: I think some brain wiring 
I have noticed that too
9/9/24, 7:29 PM - Aishwarya: It's like guys do tend to be better at some things 
Girls better at some other things 
In different professions
And other areas
9/9/24, 7:30 PM - Sayanth: Yeah probably cuz in human males are the one who used to hunt primarily so must be why males are relatively better at practical things.
9/9/24, 7:30 PM - Aishwarya: But like ,still they don't have to saying it in an insulting way 
Can still have appreciation of the other areas 
Etc
9/9/24, 7:30 PM - Sayanth: As in more physically engaging things
9/9/24, 7:30 PM - Aishwarya: Yaa probably
9/9/24, 7:31 PM - Sayanth: And women do better at more brainy things
9/9/24, 7:31 PM - Aishwarya: And guys tend to be better in logical thinking too 
Things like that 
In general
9/9/24, 7:31 PM - Sayanth: Kinda explains why STEM field is topped by girls
9/9/24, 7:31 PM - Sayanth: I'd say simpler logical thinking things usually
9/9/24, 7:32 PM - Aishwarya: And like in danger situations, I feel guys are more likely to help people or do something 
Like fire etc 

But doesn't mean guys are better as good people 
That I think girls are generally more better
9/9/24, 7:32 PM - Aishwarya: Ya
9/9/24, 7:32 PM - Aishwarya: Okay
9/9/24, 7:34 PM - Aishwarya: Probably coz the anxiety related stuff ,that's more in girls 

So probably that get activated quickly
9/9/24, 7:36 PM - Aishwarya: Idk I was just saying that you are good 🥹
Not hater mindset
9/9/24, 7:36 PM - Sayanth: Also hormonal difference
9/9/24, 7:37 PM - Aishwarya: Yaa
9/9/24, 7:37 PM - Aishwarya: True
9/9/24, 7:37 PM - Sayanth: Testosterone gives us more muscle strength too so it helps in those situations
9/9/24, 7:37 PM - Aishwarya: Yaa
9/9/24, 7:44 PM - Aishwarya: Heyy
9/9/24, 7:44 PM - Aishwarya: I wanted to say something
9/9/24, 7:44 PM - Sayanth: Yesssss
9/9/24, 7:44 PM - Aishwarya: But idk if I should say
9/9/24, 7:44 PM - Aishwarya: Likeee
9/9/24, 7:44 PM - Sayanth: Sayyyyy
9/9/24, 7:44 PM - Aishwarya: You have anxiety right

9/9/24, 7:44 PM - Sayanth: Yes so?
9/9/24, 7:45 PM - Aishwarya: Oh okay then
9/9/24, 7:45 PM - Sayanth: That's it?
9/9/24, 7:45 PM - Sayanth: 🙄
9/9/24, 7:45 PM - Aishwarya: This is what happen when my thought process of overthinking happens after I said something
9/9/24, 7:46 PM - Aishwarya: Actually it doesn't matter 
I was gonna explain in case you misunderstood
9/9/24, 7:47 PM - Aishwarya: Just that I'm very careful about my favorite friendships 
What if they leave me due to misunderstanding, which happens many times for example
9/9/24, 7:47 PM - Sayanth: It's okkk

9/13/24, 9:16 PM - Sayanth: I just pulled my shorts a bit down so that it covers a bit more area
9/13/24, 9:16 PM - Aishwarya: It's like girls who can't wear modern outfits making fun of girls who can ( either coz they live in city or town or brave etc )
9/13/24, 9:17 PM - Aishwarya: Oh :(
9/13/24, 9:18 PM - Aishwarya: You are emotionally mature 
Idk 
Guys usually say back stuff
9/13/24, 9:18 PM - Aishwarya: Or its probably coz she is older and you wanted to be bit respectful?
9/13/24, 9:18 PM - Aishwarya: Or like you don't usually say anything back to girls in general 
Like for small issues
9/13/24, 9:21 PM - Aishwarya: My bro also wears shorts at home 
But not always 
I don't know about others
9/13/24, 9:21 PM - Aishwarya: Outside sometimes
9/13/24, 9:22 PM - Aishwarya: In my college ,some guys used to wear shorts in hostel

Shirtless pic but like in long shorts 🥺
9/13/24, 9:34 PM - Aishwarya: My second college crush, he used to wear long shorts 
I feel like it's because he is too tall and that suit him more 
Like maybe he felt so 
He used to be insecure that he was too tall
9/13/24, 10:31 PM - Sayanth: Well I don't try to change other pov unless it's something that's harmful to others

One reason is coz I can send her anything 
But like we don't really talk

9/15/24, 9:28 PM - Aishwarya: Pune friend don't have instagram 
Then other two friends are not from india 
We talk only sometimes ,coz buzy

9/15/24, 9:41 PM - Aishwarya: Like please don't think I'm less good of a friend than other friends okay ( like based on reels sending )
I know it doesn't make any sense, but I just said

I do send but sometimes ,and when I do I kind of spam🥹
9/15/24, 9:47 PM - Aishwarya: You are my favorite friend now 
Doesn't have to be like that vice versa 
But you still have to give me some time everyday( maybe like 5 minutes)is what I wanted to say 🥹
9/15/24, 9:48 PM - Aishwarya: But if you are becoming very busy ( which is okay ,coz sometimes life get more buzy )

Like something off
9/15/24, 10:10 PM - Aishwarya: Also you having crush on chai means you are straight only 
Plus some guys are good ,but minority though

9/16/24, 8:58 PM - Aishwarya: I can help
9/16/24, 8:58 PM - Aishwarya: How should I help
9/16/24, 8:58 PM - Sayanth: Just guide me through it
9/16/24, 8:58 PM - Sayanth: What should I do
9/16/24, 8:59 PM - Aishwarya: Btw njn innale paranje it's not related to how straight you are
I meant that you are so good person 🥹
Wanted to say yesterday
9/16/24, 8:59 PM - Aishwarya: You probably didn't notice
9/16/24, 9:00 PM - Aishwarya: But like I felt like i wanted to clarify 
Didn't tell yesterday coz you were tired 
I had already vent so much
9/16/24, 9:01 PM - Aishwarya: Whoever that girl is 
Her bhagyam🥹
9/16/24, 9:01 PM - Aishwarya: Just be yourself
9/16/24, 9:01 PM - Aishwarya: Also make sure it doesn't distract from studies coz you are final year right
9/16/24, 9:02 PM - Aishwarya: Figure out what vibe type of girl she is
9/16/24, 9:02 PM - Aishwarya: Just be yourself but korch tricks okke use aakkaam
9/16/24, 9:06 PM - Aishwarya: That's why I don't get involved in such stuff 
Studies aadyam settle aakknm
9/16/24, 9:08 PM - Aishwarya: Yaa that I can help 
Plus if a girl likes you , not much tricks needed 
But female minds are bit complicated, so tricks can help 
In that I can help
9/16/24, 9:29 PM - Sayanth: Tbh I never really understood girls
9/16/24, 9:29 PM - Sayanth: Not even my mom
9/16/24, 9:30 PM - Sayanth: One moment she's so sweet and the very next moment she'll be like the god kaali
9/16/24, 9:30 PM - Sayanth: In human form
9/16/24, 9:32 PM - Aishwarya: Oh
Girls simple aanu
In terms of dating aanengil korch attention koduthal mathi apol venolum
But the girl has to initially like the guy atleast a bit though, in terms of looks
And in your case ,you are cute 
So don't worry 

But different girls can have different physical preferences, korch variations okke kaanum
9/16/24, 9:33 PM - Aishwarya: Oh okay 

But that I think men are like that too 
It probably depends on the person
9/16/24, 9:34 PM - Sayanth: No aishuuu
9/16/24, 9:34 PM - Aishwarya: Oh
9/16/24, 9:34 PM - Sayanth: Angane aane literally ella girlsum ente karyathil veezhendath aan
9/16/24, 9:34 PM - Sayanth: 🥺
9/16/24, 9:35 PM - Aishwarya: And the trope of girls liking 'bad guys' 
It's just that they pursue girls a lottt 
So their chance of getting yes ( and no also) from a girl increases
9/16/24, 9:35 PM - Sayanth: But enik idk I've believed that stereotype
9/16/24, 9:36 PM - Sayanth: But still ellarum kinda toxic guys nte pirake povum I think.
9/16/24, 9:36 PM - Aishwarya: Plus those kinda guys are manipulative with their words 

They love bomb a lot 
So athil aanu girls veezhune 
Pinne later alle those guys inde original swabhavam purth verunne
9/16/24, 9:38 PM - Aishwarya: But do you interact with those girls though ?
( which is not your fault ,some people are naturally more interactive with people )

I know you are nice and sweet etc
9/16/24, 9:38 PM - Sayanth: Ok back to crush topic
9/16/24, 9:39 PM - Sayanth: She calls me bro a bit too frequently!!!!
9/16/24, 9:39 PM - Aishwarya: Yaa girls do like and date 'bad boys'
It's because they love bomb 

Like no girls likes toxic guys 
Its just that their toxicness is revealed after 
And in many cases it lead to messy break up later
9/16/24, 9:40 PM - Aishwarya: Ohh😭
9/16/24, 9:40 PM - Aishwarya: Noooo
Flirty guys yes 
Toxic guys noo
9/16/24, 9:41 PM - Aishwarya: It's coz girls like the attention 
But those flirty guys flirt with everyone 

I think with enough experience, the girls think logically later on
9/16/24, 9:42 PM - Aishwarya: But even before logic, it was never the toxicness the girls were attracted to 

It's just that toxic guys mostly are narcissistic 
And they do anything to get what they want ,including love bombing etc
9/16/24, 9:43 PM - Aishwarya: But like this is bit tricky 
Just because she calls you bro doesn't mean she doesn't like you or might not like you in future <This message was edited>
9/16/24, 9:47 PM - Aishwarya: She might have called you bro ,because she didn't want to lead you on 
Or maybe she wants you to pursue her more ,some girls want guys to chase after them or something 
Or maybe she want you to think she don't like you 
Could be many reasons
9/16/24, 9:50 PM - Aishwarya: That's not true okay 
Don't change to toxic or something 🔫

Imo it's you who don't like many girls 
But at the same time, you don't seem to have high standards either
9/16/24, 9:51 PM - Aishwarya: There was some dating advice for guys that I came across
9/16/24, 9:53 PM - Aishwarya: Plus try to built the vibe in irl 
The girls you liked were from reddit right ,that has small success rate imo
9/16/24, 9:54 PM - Aishwarya: It's like, you have be bit flirty and stuff 
Like subtly
And will have to risk being creepy 💀
9/16/24, 9:54 PM - Aishwarya: It does make sense 
The guys I know who dated a lot  ,they were like that
9/16/24, 9:57 PM - Aishwarya: Idk you probably already know all this dating advice etc 
Njn advice thannu, ath use aayi ,you set aayi 
And enik one good friend closeness illathe aakum🥺
But it's okay
9/16/24, 9:58 PM - Aishwarya: I really wish you don't get girlfriend soon🥺
9/16/24, 9:58 PM - Aishwarya: But I want you to be happy 
So it's okay 🥺
9/16/24, 11:44 PM - Sayanth: Heyy
9/16/24, 11:44 PM - Sayanth: Sorry
9/16/24, 11:44 PM - Sayanth: I had to go do something
9/16/24, 11:44 PM - Aishwarya: It's okay
9/16/24, 11:45 PM - Sayanth: What u saying
9/16/24, 11:45 PM - Sayanth: I've pretty high standards
9/16/24, 11:45 PM - Aishwarya: Okay

9/16/24, 11:56 PM - Sayanth: Just say it
9/16/24, 11:56 PM - Aishwarya: Coz I'm a girl's girl
9/16/24, 11:57 PM - Aishwarya: But you are one of the few guys I care about
9/16/24, 11:57 PM - Sayanth: Just tell me dude
9/16/24, 11:57 PM - Aishwarya: Okay
9/16/24, 11:58 PM - Aishwarya: I think I will tell later
9/16/24, 11:58 PM - Sayanth: Nooo

9/16/24, 11:59 PM - Sayanth: Well she does initiate convo
9/16/24, 11:59 PM - Sayanth: Worst case she likes me as a bro
9/16/24, 11:59 PM - Aishwarya: Okay
That's good
9/16/24, 11:59 PM - Aishwarya: Yea
9/16/24, 11:59 PM - Aishwarya: But like something feels off about the whole thing
9/16/24, 11:59 PM - Sayanth: Whyyy
9/17/24, 12:00 AM - Sayanth: Like what
9/17/24, 12:00 AM - Sayanth: Tell meee
9/17/24, 12:00 AM - Aishwarya: Anyways first you see if she likes you back
9/17/24, 12:00 AM - Aishwarya: Pinne one more thing
Whichever potential girlfriend you are talking to ,don't tell them about something
9/17/24, 12:01 AM - Aishwarya: Coz like they will tell you to stop talking to me 🥺
9/17/24, 12:01 AM - Aishwarya: Most girls are so possessive ,which is valid
9/17/24, 12:02 AM - Sayanth: See I'm not gonna leave My friends
9/17/24, 12:02 AM - Sayanth: Also u don't have to worry
9/17/24, 12:02 AM - Sayanth: I don't think she will say yes to me
9/17/24, 12:02 AM - Sayanth: Anyways
9/17/24, 12:02 AM - Sayanth: I see no chance  so dw
9/17/24, 12:03 AM - Sayanth: But what is it
9/17/24, 12:03 AM - Sayanth: Gimme a clear idea
9/17/24, 12:03 AM - Aishwarya: About the spotify jam 
That you used spotify jam with me also 

It doesn't matter but like better not to take any risk 
So don't say okay
9/17/24, 12:04 AM - Sayanth: It's just music what's wrong with that tho
9/17/24, 12:06 AM - Aishwarya: Nothing 
But like if your future girlfriend is possessive ,she might ask you to cut off most girls 
Idk 

If not cut off , like to minimize contact by a lot 

Like the contact will automatically be minimized when you get a girlfriend 
Which is okay
9/17/24, 12:07 AM - Aishwarya: That's good 

I think you are kinda friends with your best friends girlfriend right 

So yea you won't cut me off when you get a girlfriend, that I know
9/17/24, 12:08 AM - Sayanth: Yeah we are
9/17/24, 12:10 AM - Aishwarya: It's just that you are a good person, so I don't want any risks of me not having any access to you 
So don't tell about spotify thing for example 😅
Plus we are not even irl friends 
So it's different, your future girlfriend might ask
9/17/24, 12:11 AM - Aishwarya: Pinne so many of your female friends call you cute and all 
So I'm safe in that 
But athum parayanda 😅
9/17/24, 12:13 AM - Aishwarya: I mean your future girlfriend may or may not be unnecessarily possessive
9/17/24, 12:13 AM - Aishwarya: But it is valid though 
Nothing wrong or right in that
9/17/24, 12:13 AM - Sayanth: Are u even sure I might get a gf
9/17/24, 12:13 AM - Sayanth: 🫠
9/17/24, 12:13 AM - Aishwarya: I mean if not this girl 
Maybe some other girl
9/17/24, 12:14 AM - Aishwarya: In future also ithonum parayanda ennu paranju vecheyaa😅
9/17/24, 12:14 AM - Sayanth: Well I'm not looking for a relationship anymore
9/17/24, 12:14 AM - Aishwarya: Okay
9/17/24, 12:14 AM - Sayanth: It's just my friends kinda forcing me to
9/17/24, 12:15 AM - Aishwarya: Ohh
Whyyyy
9/17/24, 12:15 AM - Sayanth: Also I kinda wanna move on from my old crush
9/17/24, 12:15 AM - Sayanth: Well they know she's the only girl I ever found attractive
9/17/24, 12:16 AM - Aishwarya: You shouldn't use another person to move on 
But you said you like her ,so it's different 
I understand
9/17/24, 12:16 AM - Aishwarya: Hm okay
9/17/24, 12:16 AM - Sayanth: Yeah like I'm not using her in that sense but I still feel like it's wrong
9/17/24, 12:16 AM - Sayanth: I'm kinda over my old crush
9/17/24, 12:16 AM - Aishwarya: Okay
9/17/24, 12:17 AM - Aishwarya: Okay 
That doesn't really matter 
It takes time 
As long as you have moved on from that crush when you start dating some other girl
9/17/24, 12:18 AM - Aishwarya: Also you are in final year right 
And you have to clear papers right 
Ithinde idayil time okke manage aakkan patumo?🤔
9/17/24, 12:19 AM - Sayanth: Well tbh she's topper so getting into a relationship with her only benefits me
9/17/24, 12:20 AM - Sayanth: But at the same time I don't wanna distract her from her studies
9/17/24, 12:20 AM - Aishwarya: Pinne college kazhinj you will move to another place for work right

So if you really care about her ...

9/20/24, 7:23 PM - Aishwarya: The arunpradeepmusic one 💀 I thought it's some cctv camera reference

9/20/24, 7:23 PM - Aishwarya: I thought its some sign from universe

9/20/24, 7:24 PM - Aishwarya: I was at my relatives place previously
9/20/24, 7:24 PM - Aishwarya: It might sound stupid
9/20/24, 7:24 PM - Aishwarya: But like I think it's a fear most girls have
9/20/24, 7:25 PM - Sayanth: Whaaaaa
9/20/24, 7:25 PM - Aishwarya: Like then i understood it was just my anxiety for a minute
9/20/24, 7:25 PM - Sayanth: Whats in it to even overthink

9/20/24, 7:25 PM - Aishwarya: Nothinggg

9/20/24, 7:26 PM - Aishwarya: But the reel just
9/20/24, 7:26 PM - Aishwarya: Gave me a doubt 💀
9/20/24, 7:28 PM - Aishwarya: Like friends inform and watch out for their friends right

9/20/24, 7:28 PM - Aishwarya: And I got slightly worried

9/20/24, 7:31 PM - Aishwarya: 😂
9/20/24, 7:31 PM - Aishwarya: I mean
9/20/24, 7:32 PM - Aishwarya: Also there is another angle to it
9/20/24, 7:33 PM - Aishwarya: Like people will talk about it in conservative countries
9/20/24, 7:33 PM - Aishwarya: In liberal countries people don't care
9/20/24, 7:34 PM - Aishwarya: Recently I saw a reel in which priya varrier cleavage was showing 
As expected the comment section was like I thought
9/20/24, 7:35 PM - Aishwarya: But in modern countries reel that thought never cross the mind when I watch their reels

Idk who all now
9/20/24, 7:44 PM - Aishwarya: My best friend's ex he was openly following many almost naked girls on insta

Is it that you are people pleaser and so you can't say that you don't want to spend ANYtime with me 🤔
But you don't want to say it like that
9/27/24, 12:00 AM - Aishwarya: Like that's why I explained yesterday
9/27/24, 12:01 AM - Aishwarya: I message you everyday coz I want to stay in touch with you
9/27/24, 12:01 AM - Aishwarya: Coz you told that some of your previous friends just messaged you only when they needed some help 
And not concerned about you
9/27/24, 12:02 AM - Aishwarya: So since I want to be friends with you , I wanted to be the type of friend that you want
9/27/24, 12:02 AM - Aishwarya: So I was messaging everyday 
If you don't want that 
That's fine too
9/27/24, 12:03 AM - Aishwarya: I will message weekly or whichever time interval that is okay 
Coz I know people get buzy
9/27/24, 12:05 AM - Aishwarya: But like ofcourse I care about you 
You are like a good person 
And a good friend
9/27/24, 12:06 AM - Aishwarya: But if you don't have the time , I can message weekly , or every other day or so 
(Like on normal days, coz nothing to talk or vent about right)
9/27/24, 12:13 AM - Aishwarya: And you can text me any day , any time  if you want somebody to listen ( even though you haven't really availed that I think)
And i will reply when I see the message or is free 
And vice versa 
Is such a friendship possible ?🥺🥹
9/27/24, 12:15 AM - Aishwarya: I felt like you are person who has empathy , sympathy etc when your friends struggle 
So they will feel better after talking to you 
For me it's like that
9/27/24, 12:19 AM - Aishwarya: The kolkata friend , he has listened to me a lot 
He has helped me so much 
Especially since it was on call 
But he told he won't be available till next year 😭
He has kinda told so before also , but now he has a job 
So idk
9/27/24, 12:20 AM - Aishwarya: I feel like I don't have any friends 😢
And it's not easy to make friends online 
And offline is not the vibe , coz I can't tell my secrets etc
9/27/24, 12:21 AM - Aishwarya: Now I feel you are also going 
You were like the most good  friend 🥺
9/27/24, 12:23 AM - Aishwarya: Also now my life is going alright, so I won't be yapping about anything
9/27/24, 12:24 AM - Aishwarya: But I feel safe having good friends 
Atleast one 😭
9/27/24, 12:25 AM - Aishwarya: Like a temporary dependable friend 
And vice versa 🥺
9/27/24, 12:27 AM - Aishwarya: Imagine you found a girlfriend , maybe later 
But even then there is breakup chance yk
9/27/24, 12:28 AM - Aishwarya: And while that girl is there, she will listen to you
Care about you
9/27/24, 12:28 AM - Aishwarya: But what about after that ?
9/27/24, 12:30 AM - Aishwarya: Don't you want to keep a good friendship? My friendship ? 
And people can be more free with online friends yk
9/27/24, 12:31 AM - Aishwarya: Your real life friends , it's better to not say some stuff , like secrets for example  
Coz what if it gets messy 
And you would not want to risk cutting off a real life friend who you can hangout with irl
9/27/24, 12:32 AM - Aishwarya: Soo
9/27/24, 12:32 AM - Aishwarya: Put some efforts in my friendship too 
Otherwise im gonna go
9/27/24, 12:33 AM - Aishwarya: 😓
9/27/24, 12:36 AM - Aishwarya: I like your character so much
So much better than many people I have met
9/27/24, 12:38 AM - Aishwarya: That's is the only reason why I'm over explaining so much 
Even after you have left me on read , for a longgg timeee , many times 😭

And even though you never message me , you just reply to me 
But like that's okay though
9/27/24, 12:39 AM - Aishwarya: But these days you are not replying even 🙂
What is that behavior 😭

You are my friend
But i think not vice versa 🥺
9/27/24, 1:30 PM - Sayanth: Hey

9/28/24, 7:45 AM - Aishwarya: Okay
9/28/24, 7:55 AM - Aishwarya: I got reminded of you yesterday a few times 
Like I was just thinking how long I will be friends with you 🥺
And I was kinda wishing I had more friends who are good 🥹
9/28/24, 8:00 AM - Aishwarya: It's okay 
Actually I don't have anything to talk 🥹
But would be nice to talk 

But mostly I want to be friends even if we don't talk regularly
9/28/24, 8:12 AM - Aishwarya: Sunday also you have work right ?
I understand
9/28/24, 8:14 AM - Aishwarya: How much time you will be free btw
9/28/24, 8:14 AM - Aishwarya: The buzy thing I totally understand 😊
9/28/24, 8:18 AM - Sayanth: We got this IV till Oct 2nd
9/28/24, 8:19 AM - Sayanth: Then I'll be free
9/28/24, 8:19 AM - Aishwarya: Okay
9/28/24, 8:19 AM - Sayanth: I'll be free all nights today onwards tho morning I can't guarantee
9/28/24, 8:23 AM - Aishwarya: Oh okay 🥹
Dw actually I don't have anything to talk 

But like I feel safe and more happy that I have you as my friend 
And slightly bit anxious also
Coz what if you go 
There were times with no good friends , those times were fine too 
But still
9/28/24, 8:26 AM - Aishwarya: It's just that many people gave me snake vibes 😅
9/28/24, 8:27 AM - Aishwarya: So
9/28/24, 8:27 AM - Aishwarya: Because of things like that 😑
9/28/24, 8:30 AM - Aishwarya: Idk I just wanted to say that I'm grateful to have you as my friend 🥺🥹🥳
9/28/24, 8:35 AM - Aishwarya: There were a very few friends who got kinda tired of me 😢 in the few friends I had made earlier 
But like I'm a different better person now 
Previously I used to yap so much 😪
9/28/24, 8:36 AM - Aishwarya: Not so much 
But kinda
9/28/24, 8:36 AM - Aishwarya: I hope you don't get tired or annoyed of me 🥺 
And go away
9/28/24, 8:48 AM - Aishwarya: The previous people in my life ; many of the girls were so much competitive mindset 😕
And majority guys if being nice, it's due to some hidden motives 
Or misogynistic etc  
Or something off with how they think
9/28/24, 8:48 AM - Aishwarya: Like not having bare minimum empathy even 🥺
9/28/24, 8:52 AM - Aishwarya: But you were always nice and good to me 
Because you are a good person 
You care about your friends and their mental health
9/28/24, 8:55 AM - Aishwarya: You were good to your crush who didn't like you back 
And not saying bad about her 
You were good to the girl who had crush on you 
That pinterest girl
9/28/24, 8:55 AM - Aishwarya: At the same time , you bullied back that bully guy right
9/28/24, 8:57 AM - Aishwarya: It's like you are good to people who don't try to harm you or anything 
If many people were like that, how good it would be 🥹
9/28/24, 8:57 AM - Aishwarya: 😪 sorry for the rants

10/4/24, 7:54 PM - Aishwarya: Someone who is not very busy
10/4/24, 7:54 PM - Aishwarya: Everyone is so busy 
Most

10/4/24, 8:13 PM - Aishwarya: If I understood correctly
10/4/24, 8:15 PM - Aishwarya: I have read that some to many kinda ambitious guys tend to be narcissistic 
Like they are motivated by power ,rather than interest
10/4/24, 8:16 PM - Aishwarya: Like anyways have to work to get salary 
But like some people are more passionate about their work 
Comparatively 
That I meant
10/4/24, 8:23 PM - Aishwarya: I know two girls who are kind of like acquaintances ,from online 
One girl is lawyer
She likes her work
10/4/24, 8:24 PM - Aishwarya: Girls who are like that I stan 
But guys , they can be disappointing 
Coz some are motivated by power

10/8/24, 10:07 PM - Sayanth: Ah
10/8/24, 10:07 PM - Sayanth: Shouldn't have told u
10/8/24, 10:08 PM - Sayanth: I wanted to prank u

10/8/24, 10:08 PM - Sayanth: With my new number
10/8/24, 10:08 PM - Aishwarya: Oh 😁
10/8/24, 10:08 PM - Aishwarya: Okay 🥹
10/8/24, 10:08 PM - Aishwarya: So you have two whatsapp now right
10/8/24, 10:08 PM - Aishwarya: What shall I save as contact name for second
10/8/24, 10:09 PM - Aishwarya: I was thinking
10/8/24, 10:19 PM - Sayanth: Name it whatever u like
10/8/24, 10:19 PM - Aishwarya: Ya 
Saved Sayanth New
10/8/24, 10:19 PM - Sayanth: That's kindaaaaa sooo generic
10/8/24, 10:20 PM - Aishwarya: Like one day I gave my phone to mom
10/8/24, 10:20 PM - Aishwarya: To see video of her in my gallery at a program
10/8/24, 10:20 PM - Aishwarya: And she did share option 
It was plane mode
10/8/24, 10:21 PM - Aishwarya: And my two guy friends were there 
Frequently contacted , comparatively
10/8/24, 10:21 PM - Aishwarya: Coz of that
10/8/24, 10:22 PM - Aishwarya: I don't really use phone much 
Coz not many people I have contact with 
And instagram is in tab
And non indian friends are on discord
10/8/24, 10:29 PM - Aishwarya: In the sense , my mom might take it in a wrong way 
Like parents generation is kinda like that 
So I save all names like that
10/8/24, 10:30 PM - Aishwarya: My mental health became better after i cut off contacts with my previous friends and found better friends
10/8/24, 10:31 PM - Aishwarya: My mom asked me ,you said you don't have contacts with anyone from college now ,then by friends you mean who
10/8/24, 10:32 PM - Aishwarya: Like I had told that I have better emotional support from friends , than from family 🥺
10/8/24, 10:32 PM - Aishwarya: Which is true
10/8/24, 10:32 PM - Sayanth: Oh
10/8/24, 10:32 PM - Aishwarya: Yaa
10/8/24, 10:32 PM - Sayanth: Yeah understandable
10/8/24, 10:33 PM - Aishwarya: Yaa
10/8/24, 10:33 PM - Sayanth: Again relatable
10/8/24, 10:34 PM - Aishwarya: Ya 
That's good 
Always keep close ,only people who are good for our mental health 🫂

Exception is only the classmates or work people , coz that's not avoidable
10/8/24, 10:44 PM - Aishwarya: One doubt , when the reddit chat shows someone's account as 'deleted' what does it mean ?
10/8/24, 10:44 PM - Aishwarya: Did they delete it permanently?🤔
Or can it be retrieved ?
10/8/24, 10:46 PM - Aishwarya: I wanted to send it before 
But like then I thought no 
Its chats from my another reddit account
10/8/24, 10:46 PM - Sayanth: It's permanent
10/8/24, 10:46 PM - Sayanth: U can't retrieve it
10/8/24, 10:47 PM - Aishwarya: Basically a guy had deleted his account 
I think its coz of me hehe
10/8/24, 10:47 PM - Aishwarya: Oh nice
10/8/24, 10:47 PM - Sayanth: Nice
10/8/24, 10:47 PM - Sayanth: 😂
10/8/24, 10:47 PM - Sayanth: Whyyy
10/8/24, 10:47 PM - Sayanth: Gimme the story
10/8/24, 10:47 PM - Aishwarya: Oh thanks 😅😂
10/8/24, 10:48 PM - Aishwarya: But you won't judge me right 👉👈
10/8/24, 10:48 PM - Sayanth: No
10/8/24, 10:48 PM - Aishwarya: Okay
10/8/24, 10:49 PM - Aishwarya: I'm screenshotting some stuff
10/8/24, 10:49 PM - Aishwarya: Okay, I hope so
10/8/24, 10:58 PM - Aishwarya: Chat korch scene aann😬😭🥺
10/8/24, 10:58 PM - Aishwarya: Anyways
10/8/24, 11:00 PM - Aishwarya: Its like the guy is dark skinned 
Plus major fetish for fair skin girls 
Which is like my worst trigger
And also added bullying experience from a few guys like that irl
10/8/24, 11:01 PM - Aishwarya: Like out of curiosity I had begun a conversation with him , asking about his stance on having kids
10/8/24, 11:01 PM - Aishwarya: He wanted kids
10/8/24, 11:02 PM - Aishwarya: Not just that, he was unnecessarily hating on dark skin girls 
Preference is okay understandable
10/8/24, 11:03 PM - Aishwarya: That's why I like you so much 
Atleast you are so supportive 🥺
Some people are like unnecessarily rude 🥺
10/8/24, 11:05 PM - Aishwarya: Basically I had made him feel bad about having kids and stuff 
Being the person that he is 
What all I said ,definitely had some negative impact on him 
I like to think so
10/8/24, 11:08 PM - Aishwarya: And a girl also deleted her account ,but not related to me though
10/8/24, 11:09 PM - Aishwarya: I wanted to be friends with her 
Coz me and her have similar trauma
10/8/24, 11:10 PM - Aishwarya: But then later I found out that she is kinda judgemental person 
Like harsh judgement towards something not effecting her life at alll
But regardless she wasn't interested to be friends anyways
10/8/24, 11:12 PM - Aishwarya: Like saying they are ugly 
When he is the same himself 
Like what 😂
10/8/24, 11:12 PM - Aishwarya: Where is the self awareness 😭
10/8/24, 11:13 PM - Aishwarya: Like skin colour is one of the part of beauty 
And for females that is more important than men 
But still
10/8/24, 11:15 PM - Aishwarya: Also I think I'm kinda bisexual , heteroromantic 
So like I do find fair girls more attractive ( other factors too is there ofcourse )
And in men I like in terms of skin colour, except the very dark guys 
But I do think I like lighter skin tones bit more , but skin colour is like secondary for men
10/8/24, 11:16 PM - Aishwarya: Anyways I won't make fun of someone's skin colour 
Coz isn't that insulting myself too
10/8/24, 11:18 PM - Aishwarya: But for some reason the dark guys don't think it applies to them 
Otherwise where do they get the audacity from 😭
I strongly believe it's coz the girls in general are less superficial
10/8/24, 11:20 PM - Aishwarya: But like some of the same girls are judgemental towards girls 🥺

Atleast be equally judgemental no
10/8/24, 11:21 PM - Aishwarya: Lol I have talked about this many times hehe
10/8/24, 11:21 PM - Aishwarya: Actually I just wanted to say why I value your friendship
10/8/24, 11:23 PM - Aishwarya: And I ship you with all, kinda pretty to pretty brown skin girlies, your age 🥹
Idk it makes me happy 👉👈
10/8/24, 11:24 PM - Aishwarya: I think I only know one indian guy like you yet 
So that's why okay 
Plz don't mind
10/8/24, 11:25 PM - Aishwarya: You told my skin tone is good enough right 
So like that skin tone range girls 🥹
10/8/24, 11:29 PM - Aishwarya: Also yk my second college crush , he follows one girl from my college who has like 11.5k followers now 
That girl is darker toned than me , like by two shades or so
10/8/24, 11:30 PM - Aishwarya: One reason why I liked and admired him was coz he had called a girl who was like two shades lighter than me pretty 
No other guy had said that 
Even the dark skin toned guys ,who were darker than me 
And he was fair
10/8/24, 11:31 PM - Aishwarya: And then later when he got to know I liked him 
He unfollowed that girl on insta 
And he had told that he kinda liked me only because I was obsessed with him 
Things like that
10/8/24, 11:32 PM - Aishwarya: Like I didn't even want to date him ,I liked him that's all 
And also grateful that he helped me with some study related stuff ( and some guys didn't coz I was neither in pretty nor extrovert outgoing category )
10/8/24, 11:33 PM - Aishwarya: And then he started dating a girl 
From our same class 
I was heartbroken about it ,especially coz I had to see them everyday
10/8/24, 11:34 PM - Aishwarya: And then after a month his mom died of cancer 
Idk if he felt like it's bit karma or something
10/8/24, 11:34 PM - Aishwarya: Coz after that he became nice to me again 
Idk
10/8/24, 11:35 PM - Aishwarya: And after college he is following this girl 🤔
And she is not following him back even 
I think he wanted to be like better person 
Like showing support to dark skin girls too 
Idk
10/8/24, 11:36 PM - Aishwarya: I used to search her account ,coz she is kinda one of my inspiration 
I don't follow her
Her account is public
10/8/24, 11:37 PM - Aishwarya: Yk my best friend from college, she is not following this girl 😭
Like why
10/8/24, 11:37 PM - Aishwarya: But she is following another north indian fair girl who has 10 k plus following 
She also don't follow her back
10/8/24, 11:38 PM - Aishwarya: But she can date a dark skin guy , who ideally should belong to us dark skin girlies 🥺
10/8/24, 11:38 PM - Aishwarya: Anyways whatever
10/8/24, 11:39 PM - Aishwarya: And he was clearly darker than this girl
10/8/24, 11:40 PM - Aishwarya: Like where is the support for girls 🥺
10/8/24, 11:40 PM - Aishwarya: 😓😪
10/8/24, 11:41 PM - Aishwarya: You are so good and sweet 🥺
So supportive 🥹
10/8/24, 11:46 PM - Aishwarya: I will definitely give the gifts you told about, and more 
But that is only if you marry a brown skin girl
( I think that college junior girl is kinda that skin tone range )🥹
But yea marry any girl you like fair ,tan ,brown ,any girl
But I was just saying
10/8/24, 11:47 PM - Aishwarya: Anyways, I will always be a good supportive friend to you 
Coz you are a good supportive friend to me 
And you are so good person in general 🥹
10/8/24, 11:48 PM - Aishwarya: https://www.instagram.com/p/DAit9METGbO/?igsh=ODJwNjhmZjR4ajFi
10/8/24, 11:49 PM - Aishwarya: This was on my feed today 🥹
I stan
10/8/24, 11:51 PM - Aishwarya: Probably for PR too 
But still🥹
Indian representation 
So rare
10/9/24, 12:00 AM - Aishwarya: Btw ofcourse I want the good for you 
So I meant like, brown skin range ,but a pretty girl 
You told I look pretty right 
Like there are prettier girls in my skin tone range girls too 
Them I meant , not like any brown girl btw
In that ,girls in your similar age, plus good education etc ,nice personality etc
10/9/24, 12:02 AM - Aishwarya: I would stan so much 
Would be one of my favorite couples for real
10/9/24, 12:04 AM - Aishwarya: But like not now if possible 
Coz I don't have supportive friends who has time for me also as of now
10/9/24, 12:17 AM - Aishwarya: Omg so many messages 💀 plz don't mind 
I have told most of it before 
Idk how it turned into another rant 
Feel free to skip through them 
Or read only when you are totallyyy freee
10/9/24, 12:17 AM - Aishwarya: Good night
10/10/24, 10:53 PM - Aishwarya: Hey
10/10/24, 10:53 PM - Aishwarya: How are you today ?
10/10/24, 10:54 PM - Aishwarya: Hope you are fine
10/10/24, 10:55 PM - Aishwarya: You told your homework is done for the week right
10/10/24, 10:55 PM - Aishwarya: So why no reply at all 😅
10/10/24, 11:00 PM - Aishwarya: Is it because I sometimes rant so much 
And too messages and you don't want to waste the time to read ?
10/10/24, 11:00 PM - Aishwarya: Which is understandable
10/10/24, 11:00 PM - Aishwarya: But you should say that , otherwise how can I know
10/10/24, 11:01 PM - Aishwarya: Like you saying that is lot better than not replying anything
10/10/24, 11:01 PM - Aishwarya: I mean like you don't have respond to every message 
Or even read
10/10/24, 11:01 PM - Aishwarya: But like not replying at all 
It feels like I'm talking to a wall 😅
10/10/24, 11:03 PM - Aishwarya: Like these are one of the factors that lead to slow death of friendships
10/10/24, 11:03 PM - Aishwarya: I think you don't value the friendship 
Which probably you have better friends that's why
10/10/24, 11:05 PM - Aishwarya: Anyways I don't want to be friends with a wall 
That is what talking to you feels like for me, since some weeks😓
10/10/24, 11:05 PM - Aishwarya: Soo
10/10/24, 11:06 PM - Aishwarya: When we are not friends anymore, don't be like , oh everyone is only talking to you when they need something 
(Like you told about a few friends)
10/10/24, 11:07 PM - Aishwarya: I'm one of those friends who care about you
10/10/24, 11:08 PM - Aishwarya: But you don't want that it seems
10/10/24, 11:09 PM - Aishwarya: Like I cannot manage many friends ,I don't have time either
Looks like you are not someone interested to talk to me even for some time everyday or so 😪
10/10/24, 11:10 PM - Aishwarya: So like I thought maybe that constant friend is you to talk about the day 
But like for me you are a wall
10/10/24, 11:10 PM - Sayanth: Depressed and tired I got a fever 🤒
10/10/24, 11:10 PM - Aishwarya: Oh :(

10/13/24, 7:31 PM - Aishwarya: Ofcourse not
10/13/24, 7:33 PM - Aishwarya: I was talking to my kolkata friend on call 
He had tagged me in a reel with caption attractive human award 
I felt like it's overcompensating or something 
Like I had told him to delete the comment 
And he said to send some reels 
Then I did
10/13/24, 7:33 PM - Aishwarya: He sometimes calls me 
I think he has so much time 
He is no longer doing MBA preparations 
He got a job
10/13/24, 7:34 PM - Aishwarya: So I explained to him ,its not related to how close I consider a friend 
Its just that I have less time 
And then I told we can just call once a week
10/13/24, 7:35 PM - Aishwarya: I was like bit crying for a minute coz of some misunderstanding of my brother
10/13/24, 7:35 PM - Aishwarya: Then I was like why people are like this
10/13/24, 7:35 PM - Aishwarya: Then the first person I remembered who is good is who yk
10/13/24, 7:35 PM - Aishwarya: Its you
10/13/24, 7:36 PM - Aishwarya: I was like even though you are buzy ,I got lucky to meet you 😇
10/13/24, 7:37 PM - Aishwarya: Yesterday I thought of messaging you today ,to ask how is studies going 
I was gonna message bit earlier
10/13/24, 7:37 PM - Aishwarya: I mean you messaged hehe
10/13/24, 7:38 PM - Aishwarya: How can anyone be mad you 🥹
I don't know if you asked like this seriously or like simply
10/13/24, 7:39 PM - Aishwarya: You are soo '🐱' coded 🥹
10/13/24, 7:44 PM - Aishwarya: I had forwarded a youtube vlog made by a junior girl in my college in my family group 
My bro's comment was nalla camera ille ?

😓
10/13/24, 7:45 PM - Aishwarya: The camera quality was good imo 
Like nice enough
10/13/24, 7:46 PM - Aishwarya: Nalle onnum parayan illel mindathe irunnude😒
10/13/24, 7:49 PM - Aishwarya: And then I send the chat screenshot of me telling the junior girl this

Omg 😍kidu daa
One of the best vlog on internet that I have ever seen
Pinne new favorite video on internet 🌹
Kidu visuals 
And kidu presentation daa 
Pinne nalla voice 👌

This
10/13/24, 7:50 PM - Aishwarya: Then my brother commented in group ,it's soap
10/13/24, 7:50 PM - Aishwarya: Soap alla
Sherikum thoniya karyam aanu paranje🥹
The vlog by itself might not be the best 
But ende college alle 
So it's really special for me 
So it's the best vlog for me 
So it's subjective

Then I told this
10/13/24, 7:51 PM - Aishwarya: Not serious 
He was joking kinda ,probably 
But since I'm sensitive 🥺
10/13/24, 7:51 PM - Aishwarya: After a minute ellam okay aayi
10/13/24, 7:51 PM - Aishwarya: Again so many messages 😬
10/13/24, 7:52 PM - Aishwarya: Okay thats it
10/13/24, 7:52 PM - Aishwarya: I just wanted to say that you are so precious 
You chose your words so wisely 🥹
So sweet you are 
Always
10/13/24, 7:59 PM - Aishwarya: Like I literally think that, if every girl has a dad like you ,a friend like you ,a boyfriend like you ,a brother like you , they would so much better mentally 
Or like one of the above 

Like guys like you 🥹
10/13/24, 8:00 PM - Aishwarya: Your character is so good 
Comparatively atleast
10/13/24, 8:01 PM - Aishwarya: I think the only problem a bit ,is that you have depressed phases 
But that is okay
10/13/24, 8:01 PM - Aishwarya: Idk that is how I think of you as a person
10/13/24, 8:02 PM - Aishwarya: But I could be wrong though 💀
Coz people can hide their true self yk
10/13/24, 8:04 PM - Aishwarya: Also, you are this mature at 21 
So imagine how much good person to be around you will be for other after some more years in life 🥹
10/13/24, 8:04 PM - Aishwarya: So be proud of yourself
10/13/24, 8:06 PM - Aishwarya: 1,454,356,734

Not important though
10/15/24, 7:53 PM - Aishwarya: With one friend
10/15/24, 7:59 PM - Aishwarya: Will you be free on Saturday or Sunday?
For sometime
10/15/24, 7:59 PM - Sayanth: Tired
10/15/24, 7:59 PM - Aishwarya: Actually it's related to friends in general 
So I wanted to say about it to you
10/15/24, 7:59 PM - Sayanth: Depressed
10/15/24, 7:59 PM - Sayanth: Exhausted

10/15/24, 8:00 PM - Aishwarya: 😭
10/15/24, 8:01 PM - Aishwarya: I just cut off a friend coz I felt unsafe 🥺
10/15/24, 8:01 PM - Aishwarya: Are you for real 😭

Its not that important thing to talk 

Just be a basic good friend to me 
That's all I expect 😊
10/15/24, 8:06 PM - Aishwarya: Is it almost done ?
10/15/24, 8:07 PM - Aishwarya: Will you be free tomorrow ? 😅
10/15/24, 8:09 PM - Sayanth: Not at all
10/15/24, 8:09 PM - Sayanth: I've not even started
10/15/24, 8:09 PM - Aishwarya: Ohh
10/15/24, 8:09 PM - Sayanth: Hopefully I guess so
10/15/24, 8:09 PM - Aishwarya: Start soon 😭
10/15/24, 8:10 PM - Aishwarya: Okay

10/15/24, 8:12 PM - Aishwarya: Do you want any help?  😅💀
10/15/24, 8:12 PM - Aishwarya: Okay anyways 
Start soon 😊
10/15/24, 8:51 PM - Aishwarya: Back to friends again 🥹
10/15/24, 8:52 PM - Aishwarya: I think I have this tendency to cut off people, if I feel that they are not that good of a friend like I thought 😓
Idk why
10/15/24, 9:15 PM - Sayanth: U probably can't
10/15/24, 9:16 PM - Sayanth: But appreciate that tho
10/15/24, 9:16 PM - Aishwarya: Oh probably?
But there a probability that I can ?

Oh you were being nice right
10/15/24, 9:16 PM - Aishwarya: No mention 🥹
10/15/24, 9:17 PM - Aishwarya: If so 
Tell me🥹
I wanna help 

But I think I will be bit sad if I can't help afterwards 💀😭
10/15/24, 9:17 PM - Aishwarya: So yea if I can't help 
Then don't ask haha
10/15/24, 9:18 PM - Sayanth: I mean do u know anything about linux commands or programming then yes else no, most of my classmates don't know either so I'm skeptical u might know at all
10/15/24, 9:18 PM - Aishwarya: 😭🥺🙂
10/15/24, 9:18 PM - Aishwarya: Really ?
Most of your classmates don't know ? 😯
10/15/24, 9:19 PM - Aishwarya: Oh I remember your voice note
10/15/24, 9:20 PM - Aishwarya: Most didn't know ,in the first year 
But later they picked up
10/15/24, 9:23 PM - Aishwarya: 🥹
10/15/24, 9:25 PM - Aishwarya: I'm curious now 

You just said simply right ?
10/15/24, 9:29 PM - Sayanth: They don't know shit tbh
10/15/24, 9:30 PM - Aishwarya: Oh💀
10/15/24, 9:30 PM - Aishwarya: Okay
10/15/24, 9:31 PM - Aishwarya: Keep company of the good classmates 🥹
10/15/24, 9:31 PM - Aishwarya: I remember that my studies had improved bit more after I became friends with my best friend from college 🥹
10/15/24, 9:32 PM - Aishwarya: She had scholarship 🥹
10/15/24, 9:33 PM - Aishwarya: I mean like don't get influenced by classmates who don't study well
Things like that
10/15/24, 9:35 PM - Aishwarya: My first friend was competitive of marks with me 
But like just in jealous way , not a wanting good marks for herself and working for it very hard kind of way
10/15/24, 9:36 PM - Aishwarya: That was there in school too 
One girl used to wake up at 5am to study for board exams 
But she was the type to say ,she is getting marks without studying
10/15/24, 9:36 PM - Aishwarya: Some others also
10/15/24, 9:37 PM - Aishwarya: And they use to make fun of people who study in class 

They acted so cool 
And then secretly studied at home 💀
10/15/24, 9:40 PM - Aishwarya: Like you already know all this
10/15/24, 9:42 PM - Aishwarya: Just a reminder that if some classmates are that vibe , keep mental distance 
So that it doesn't effect studies in any way 
Just small effects mostly but still
10/16/24, 8:22 PM - Aishwarya: Hey
10/16/24, 8:22 PM - Aishwarya: How was today ?
10/16/24, 9:21 PM - Sayanth: Bad
10/16/24, 9:21 PM - Sayanth: I'm exhausted
10/16/24, 9:21 PM - Sayanth: Got a lot to finish
10/16/24, 9:21 PM - Aishwarya: Oh
10/16/24, 9:21 PM - Aishwarya: Okay
10/16/24, 9:21 PM - Aishwarya: Anything happened ?
10/16/24, 9:22 PM - Aishwarya: Also that thing was sorted 
Which I was talking about yesterday
10/16/24, 9:23 PM - Aishwarya: Oh and I have doubt
10/16/24, 9:23 PM - Aishwarya: Like it's just that you are buzy right
10/16/24, 9:23 PM - Aishwarya: You are not annoyed right
10/16/24, 9:25 PM - Aishwarya: Coz sometimes I have just vented and messaged so much without asking if you have the energy to listen 😅
Like a few times
10/16/24, 9:26 PM - Aishwarya: I think tired and exhausted right
10/16/24, 9:26 PM - Aishwarya: Anyways if you want someone talk ,I can listen 
Just reminding
10/16/24, 9:28 PM - Aishwarya: Its like I feel you are a good person,  so if I can help sometimes, then its not really waste of time for me
10/16/24, 9:29 PM - Aishwarya: https://www.reddit.com/r/KindVoice/s/dswI0jQY9s
10/16/24, 9:29 PM - Aishwarya: Kind of like this
10/16/24, 9:30 PM - Aishwarya: But since I already know you for some while , you are a verified good person
10/16/24, 9:31 PM - Aishwarya: In the sense I don't want to help people ,who don't deserve it 
Like that's waste of energy
10/16/24, 9:31 PM - Aishwarya: Soo
10/16/24, 9:31 PM - Aishwarya: If you want someone to listen, count me too
10/16/24, 9:32 PM - Aishwarya: But yea , that doesn't really help you it seems
10/16/24, 9:32 PM - Aishwarya: But I just said 😇
10/17/24, 9:47 AM - Sayanth: hey ill respond later
10/17/24, 2:24 PM - Aishwarya: Okay😊
10/18/24, 6:46 PM - Sayanth: Heyyy
10/18/24, 6:46 PM - Sayanth: I'm thinking of taking a break from social media and all social interactions
10/18/24, 6:46 PM - Sayanth: I'll text u btw just won't be active much
10/18/24, 6:47 PM - Sayanth: If there's anything urgent u can text me here I'll respond asap
10/18/24, 6:47 PM - Sayanth: Btw how's ur day
10/18/24, 9:32 PM - Aishwarya: Hey🥺🥹
10/18/24, 9:32 PM - Aishwarya: Oh
10/18/24, 9:33 PM - Aishwarya: I hope you are alright
10/18/24, 9:38 PM - Aishwarya: Oh 
Actually nothing urgent will be there 
I think because I have talked about stuff enough with some people ,so like now if something happens, talking about it doesn't make a difference
10/18/24, 9:41 PM - Aishwarya: There was a fight with dad

But now I'm okay though
10/18/24, 9:43 PM - Aishwarya: What happened suddenly though 
If you don't mind saying
10/18/24, 9:44 PM - Aishwarya: https://www.instagram.com/reel/DAz5cuBhVl3/?igsh=ZmdmMGJldm5sdmQx
10/18/24, 9:45 PM - Aishwarya: This seems like a balanced productive way
10/18/24, 9:46 PM - Aishwarya: Like any problem with anyone?
10/18/24, 9:50 PM - Aishwarya: <Media omitted>
10/18/24, 9:51 PM - Aishwarya: Like yesterday I had installed an app to find someone to talk to 
Like possibly make a friend
10/18/24, 9:52 PM - Aishwarya: This person is doing work from home
So his friends are online friends 
Atleast that is what he told
10/18/24, 9:52 PM - Aishwarya: I hope I find atleast one friend who is good like you
10/18/24, 9:58 PM - Aishwarya: <Media omitted>
10/18/24, 10:00 PM - Aishwarya: Its not even that I want to talk to friends or anyone 
Its just that when I think about people in my circle ,I feel sad 
Like the world is bad
10/18/24, 11:01 PM - Aishwarya: Omg like my kolkata friend called 🥺
I didn't want to talk about it or anything 
But like he listened
10/18/24, 11:01 PM - Aishwarya: And like just knowing that world is not so bad and people do care made me happy 🥹
10/18/24, 11:08 PM - Aishwarya: I know you are exhausted too , so I don't expect you to listen to me or anything
10/18/24, 11:09 PM - Aishwarya: Plus it doesn't really make much of a difference
10/18/24, 11:11 PM - Aishwarya: I don't know what you are going through 🥺
Like if there is some issues with someone or some people 
Or like if you are feeling sad and exhausted coz of all the work 

But just count me also in the list of people who care about you
10/18/24, 11:16 PM - Aishwarya: You are one of the few people I care about 
Its because you are good person
10/18/24, 11:19 PM - Aishwarya: And I think you are awesome because you are talented, empathetic,  cute etc 
Cute and all can lessen though 
I feel like you are bit hard on yourself ,so just reminding
10/18/24, 11:21 PM - Aishwarya: I care about you because i think you are a good person 
But idk if it's true 🙂
10/18/24, 11:25 PM - Aishwarya: In the sense ,I don't like that many people 
I want to genuinely be a good person and be nice etc
10/18/24, 11:26 PM - Aishwarya: Its like i have some negative judgements and energy towards some previous friends ,classmates etc
But it's mostly gone though
10/18/24, 11:27 PM - Aishwarya: I think many people are probably like that
10/18/24, 11:27 PM - Aishwarya: You are also probably like that 
Idk 
Like it's not uncommon
10/18/24, 11:29 PM - Aishwarya: Is there anything that I said in general 
Or like anything like that, coz of which you don't really consider me a good friend anymore ?
10/18/24, 11:30 PM - Aishwarya: Like some people don't like how I think etc 
But they never became my friends though 
They just said bye in the beginning itself
10/18/24, 11:31 PM - Aishwarya: So it's not that
10/18/24, 11:31 PM - Aishwarya: I think you were actually just buzy
10/18/24, 11:34 PM - Aishwarya: Idk what you mean by this but you should talk to your good friends 
Like good friends ,not me specifically 
Don't isolate yourself okay
Idk if I understood correctly though
10/18/24, 11:35 PM - Aishwarya: Good social interactions are important for mental health 💜
10/18/24, 11:35 PM - Aishwarya: It can your parent or sibling
If not friends 
Or like good persons
10/18/24, 11:35 PM - Aishwarya: Like you already know
10/18/24, 11:36 PM - Aishwarya: Also i felt like I'm disturbing you by messaging everyday and asking how are you today etc
10/18/24, 11:38 PM - Aishwarya: And I felt some type of way about it
10/18/24, 11:38 PM - Aishwarya: So like since you are taking a break 
Would me messaging you everyday, feel like a chore for you to reply
10/18/24, 11:39 PM - Aishwarya: Like you have to tell correctly 
So that I can message accordingly 
I just want to remain in contact with you coz I have just very very few friends 🥺
10/18/24, 11:45 PM - Aishwarya: Its because I have zero irl friends
My current friends are from online 
For me personally ,they are better than my irl friends I had 
Probably because I could choose good friends that way
10/18/24, 11:46 PM - Aishwarya: But even though you are a good person ,you are inconsistent friend coz you are always buzy 
Or you have better friends you vibe with 
Which I understand
10/18/24, 11:47 PM - Aishwarya: But I would still like to stay friends with you ,without drifting apart
10/18/24, 11:47 PM - Aishwarya: Yk coz it's online friends ,I feel contacting after long time means no longer friends 🥺
10/18/24, 11:48 PM - Aishwarya: Unlike friends who have known from irl , school for example ,they can disappear for a long time and be friends again
10/18/24, 11:50 PM - Aishwarya: So like
10/18/24, 11:50 PM - Aishwarya: Shall I message you everyday
10/18/24, 11:50 PM - Aishwarya: Or less often
10/18/24, 11:50 PM - Aishwarya: What do you want
10/18/24, 11:50 PM - Aishwarya: Like I know you are buzy
10/18/24, 11:50 PM - Aishwarya: So according to that
10/18/24, 11:50 PM - Aishwarya: What
10/18/24, 11:51 PM - Aishwarya: Like how often shall I message you 
Everyday, or like every 3 days like that
10/18/24, 11:51 PM - Aishwarya: Reply to this okay 🙂
10/18/24, 11:54 PM - Aishwarya: In fact I also prefer low maintenance type of friends 
Coz people don't always have the energy to message everyday 
Everyone has their own life ,things like that 
Rat race kind of stuff
10/18/24, 11:59 PM - Aishwarya: Good night
10/18/24, 11:59 PM - Aishwarya: Please reply to this okay 🙂
10/18/24, 11:59 PM - Sayanth: Hey I'm reading all this ok
10/18/24, 11:59 PM - Aishwarya: Oh
10/18/24, 11:59 PM - Aishwarya: Okay 🥹
10/18/24, 11:59 PM - Sayanth: I'm just too busy at the moment that's why
10/19/24, 12:00 AM - Aishwarya: Okay
10/19/24, 12:00 AM - Sayanth: I do appreciate all this
10/19/24, 12:00 AM - Aishwarya: No hurries
10/19/24, 12:00 AM - Sayanth: Just don't think I'm ignoring
10/19/24, 12:00 AM - Aishwarya: Okay
10/19/24, 12:00 AM - Aishwarya: Okay 😇
Its just that you are one of few good persons that I have met 🥹
10/19/24, 7:38 PM - Aishwarya: Hey
10/19/24, 7:39 PM - Aishwarya: Reply please 😊
10/19/24, 7:39 PM - Aishwarya: Add once a week also
10/19/24, 7:40 PM - Aishwarya: Also 
Does this mean ,if i have anything urgent , then text you 
You will reply 

Otherwise it's okay no need to text

Did I understand correctly ?
10/19/24, 7:41 PM - Aishwarya: But like you will still consider me a friend right
10/19/24, 7:43 PM - Aishwarya: I have just very few friends ,so want to keep them ,without drifting apart 
You are an important friend to me 
As of now
10/19/24, 7:48 PM - Aishwarya: Also I wanted to ask something 
Like that blue tshirt friend for example ,he is your real friend right 
But you guys don't talk that often right 
But like hangout every month or so
10/19/24, 7:48 PM - Aishwarya: Do you consider me also a real friend of yours ?
10/19/24, 7:48 PM - Aishwarya: Or like just a random friend
10/19/24, 7:49 PM - Aishwarya: If I message you like once a week , you will still consider me a friend right
10/19/24, 7:50 PM - Aishwarya: Since you are buzy , I don't want to disturb you by messaging everyday 😓 
Plus I don't want to feel like I'm bothering you
10/19/24, 7:51 PM - Aishwarya: So like ,I will message you once a week ?
10/19/24, 7:51 PM - Aishwarya: Please reply when you are free 🙂
10/19/24, 7:59 PM - Aishwarya: Oh no 
Not as close as him I meant
10/19/24, 7:59 PM - Aishwarya: Like I'm also a real friend right
10/19/24, 7:59 PM - Aishwarya: Like that
10/19/24, 8:01 PM - Aishwarya: You know that I also care about you right 
So my friendship is also something to be valued 🙂
10/19/24, 8:03 PM - Aishwarya: You told about few friends that they only reached out to you ,when they needed some help 
And from what you said you didn't like them 
Atleast didn't like that about them 
So yea didn't like them
10/19/24, 8:05 PM - Aishwarya: Like I'm not such a person
I care about people that I consider my actual friends
10/19/24, 8:08 PM - Aishwarya: I don't consider you my special friend anymore 🙂
But like you are one of the few good persons that I have met
10/19/24, 8:09 PM - Aishwarya: So I want to remain friends with you 
So how to be in contact with you since it's online friends
10/19/24, 8:10 PM - Aishwarya: Will you be like ,who are you 🥲
If I message after a long time for example
10/19/24, 8:10 PM - Aishwarya: It has happened with some school friends and all
10/19/24, 8:13 PM - Aishwarya: I feel like I'm trying to remain friends with a wall 🥲
Coz good person are not so common unfortunately 
And because you are a good person from what I know about you
10/19/24, 8:36 PM - Sayanth: ok that hurts actually
10/19/24, 8:37 PM - Sayanth: u can text its jut i cant reply always ill read them but i wont get enough time to reply
10/19/24, 8:37 PM - Aishwarya: I just said in a flow 
Like you don't even reply for a day 🙂
10/19/24, 8:37 PM - Aishwarya: You are one of the best persons ever 🙂
10/19/24, 8:38 PM - Aishwarya: Ya

10/19/24, 8:39 PM - Aishwarya: Otherwise I feel like I'm a burden 
And that I'm bothering you 
Coz of being left on delivered for a day

10/19/24, 8:42 PM - Aishwarya: Okay then
10/19/24, 9:05 PM - Sayanth: yessss
10/21/24, 7:26 PM - Aishwarya: Hey 
How was today ?
10/21/24, 7:27 PM - Aishwarya: Didn't want to take up any Sunday time of yours , so didn't message yesterday 
I think i will message mostly on weekdays to check up on you 🥹
10/21/24, 7:27 PM - Aishwarya: Hope today was fine 
And that you are able to handle work stress well
10/22/24, 8:23 PM - Aishwarya: Hey

10/22/24, 9:08 PM - Aishwarya: Coz I found it interesting
10/22/24, 9:10 PM - Aishwarya: When you get free ,can you send your notes if it's okay ,like few pages 
Like maybe on weekend
10/22/24, 9:10 PM - Aishwarya: I will remind on weekend to send
10/22/24, 9:11 PM - Aishwarya: Handwritten notes
10/22/24, 9:12 PM - Aishwarya: You working on projects is so cool 🥹
Talented friends >> 
I stan
10/22/24, 9:16 PM - Aishwarya: Like most of them are mandatory projects 
But still
10/22/24, 9:20 PM - Aishwarya: All these make you more talented to create robo like projects right 🥹
Your parents would be so proud of you 
So cool son they have 
And so nice also 
Slay
10/22/24, 9:24 PM - Aishwarya: Like you are good person
That's enough 
So you are a blessing to your friends and people surrounding you
10/22/24, 9:25 PM - Aishwarya: But there is more 
So slay 🥹
10/22/24, 9:26 PM - Aishwarya: Maybe korch over aayit thonnam 
But like seriously I'm saying 🥹
Sho
10/22/24, 9:26 PM - Aishwarya: Nalla swabhavom
10/22/24, 9:26 PM - Aishwarya: Pinne talent um
10/22/24, 9:27 PM - Aishwarya: Just wanted to remind you 🥹
10/22/24, 9:42 PM - Aishwarya: Few of my friends don't like their work 
I think they don't like work in general 
But in that few of them don't want kids , so like I don't judge
10/22/24, 9:43 PM - Aishwarya: But yk my kolkata friend 
He had quit his mba preparations 
And he rushed into a job 
Like without an mba 
Just bcom
10/22/24, 9:43 PM - Aishwarya: And afaik he don't have anything to be depressed about 
But depression doesn't work like that ,that I know
10/22/24, 9:44 PM - Aishwarya: Like he has told me, more than a few times , about meet up 
I think he is not joking 
Idk
10/22/24, 9:46 PM - Aishwarya: But I feel like he has some links to human trafficking or something 💀
10/22/24, 9:47 PM - Aishwarya: Oh btw a used to be friend, texted me 
The one who had blocked me ,for no particular reason
10/22/24, 9:48 PM - Aishwarya: <Media omitted>
10/22/24, 9:50 PM - Aishwarya: I just told all this , to say that you are one of my few normal friends
Like good vibes 
Or atleast not problematic vibe
10/22/24, 9:51 PM - Aishwarya: Like one of his dream is to go to south america 
That place is bit sus 

That is just one reason
10/22/24, 9:52 PM - Aishwarya: Like a 0.5 percent chance 
But better to be safe 
And he is someone who has victim mentality ( he thinks reservation is one of the main reason for his suffering)
10/22/24, 9:54 PM - Aishwarya: I even feel like he sometimes have listened to me vent about my dad issues,  so that he can feel better about his life 

Or he can feel like the lower caste people are suffering 
Or both
10/22/24, 9:55 PM - Aishwarya: I haven't told that this is how I feel about him as a friend ,lowkey 
Coz he gonna go away from my life 🥺
This is a small doubt though
10/22/24, 9:55 PM - Aishwarya: And I don't have that many friends
10/22/24, 9:55 PM - Aishwarya: Especially a friend who has time
10/22/24, 9:57 PM - Aishwarya: I lowkey regret cutting off my Delhi friend 
One girl 
Like she had offered to listen to me and she did 
But in text 
So not as effective in call
10/22/24, 9:58 PM - Aishwarya: Like text is not effective as call 
As it's quicker also
10/22/24, 9:59 PM - Aishwarya: Like she acted like I can trust he fully 

But she didn't trust me ,because she had deleted a post on reddit ( which was a bit personal )
I think I'm the only person who knows her outside of reddit ,so why she delete that
10/22/24, 10:00 PM - Aishwarya: Anyways I had cut her off because she was like competing with me for some stupid guy
10/22/24, 10:04 PM - Aishwarya: I think I will no longer be friends with him when I have new friends 
Or like irl friends
10/22/24, 10:05 PM - Aishwarya: I lowkey feel he don't see me as a friend because he has this victim mentality about the reservation 
( I haven't had reservation myself ,I had told him that though)

But I think his resentment is towards people who got the reservation 
So not me 

But can't be sure though
10/22/24, 10:07 PM - Aishwarya: The human trafficking thing is an extreme 
Like nano possibility 💀
10/22/24, 10:07 PM - Aishwarya: But lowkey feel if he know my mutuals( but he don't know ) , he would say my secrets to them
Idk
10/22/24, 10:09 PM - Aishwarya: Not mutuals 
But like people I know
10/22/24, 10:11 PM - Aishwarya: I have told my secrets to only this guy ,pune girl , delhi girl and you
10/22/24, 10:12 PM - Aishwarya: And the mallu guy who went US
10/22/24, 10:13 PM - Aishwarya: In these only you I trust
10/22/24, 10:14 PM - Aishwarya: Like atleast enough to not have the mentality to hurt another person 
That too just simply
10/23/24, 8:01 PM - Aishwarya: Hey
10/23/24, 8:01 PM - Aishwarya: How are you today?
10/23/24, 8:01 PM - Aishwarya: Hope you are fine and doing well
10/23/24, 9:09 PM - Sayanth: How are u
10/23/24, 9:09 PM - Sayanth: I'm still a bit depressed
10/23/24, 9:10 PM - Sayanth: Had dinner ?
10/23/24, 9:28 PM - Aishwarya: I'm fine
10/23/24, 9:28 PM - Aishwarya: Ya had dinner
10/23/24, 9:28 PM - Aishwarya: Wbu 
Had dinner ?
10/23/24, 9:29 PM - Aishwarya: Oh:( 😕
Is it due to work and studies ?
Whatever it is ,I hope you feel okay soon
10/23/24, 9:30 PM - Aishwarya: You deserve to be happy 🥺
You are so good person
10/23/24, 9:32 PM - Aishwarya: I hope you feel like neutral atleast 🥺

Probably that is what you meant by bit depressed I hope 
Like not feeling happy 
Most people are not happy ,not to compare but still 
My way of consoling 😅
But its true though 

Try to be in neutral state of mind
10/23/24, 9:33 PM - Aishwarya: But like thinking most people are not happy is not real 
Even in social media 
Coz some ,or like many people are in fact happy
10/23/24, 9:34 PM - Aishwarya: But like everything can change in a second 
Including happiness

Try to be present in the moment
10/23/24, 9:35 PM - Aishwarya: Like while doing your works for example ,try to be present in it ,to your maximum capacity
10/23/24, 9:36 PM - Aishwarya: And these days it's advised to get involved in hobbies and stuff like that 
To take mind away from the overthinking etc 
To keep the mind occupied 
Hobbies can be work too 
Coz not everyone can be in hobbies ,atleast most of the time
10/23/24, 9:37 PM - Aishwarya: And cut off negative people 
If it's someone in class or something, it can be difficult 
But like try to keep mental distance 
If that is the case
10/23/24, 9:40 PM - Aishwarya: If it's related to some girl 
Or like seeing couples around you 
Or something like that 
Try to remember like cons of that 
Like maybe their relationship is not that good 
It maybe not the most moral way to be ,but not opposite of moral either 
But like it helps
10/23/24, 9:42 PM - Aishwarya: I had told that I do stuff like that to help with my mental health ( it's like life tips to me )
Also have heard this recommended else where 

And my therapist girl was like saying , oh why are you doing that 💀
Its like her trying to act like she know more about what works for me 
Like ofcourse not trying to discredit her coz she is therapist
10/23/24, 9:43 PM - Aishwarya: Yk I literally know a therapist girl 
From one group 
I mean like I know her 
But like she don't know me 
In the sense just know about her
10/23/24, 9:43 PM - Aishwarya: Anyways like therapist are supposed to know to adapt their mind better right
10/23/24, 9:43 PM - Aishwarya: But like
10/23/24, 9:44 PM - Aishwarya: She has a boyfriend
And she has a crush on another guy 
I have told about this story before 
Idk if you remember
10/23/24, 9:47 PM - Aishwarya: <Media omitted>
10/23/24, 9:47 PM - Aishwarya: This was a conversation with one girl I told about 
From a group
10/23/24, 9:50 PM - Aishwarya: Like I was just saying to this girl that ,I don't like this therapist girl ,and another girl etc
Coz she asked why I don't interact in the group
10/23/24, 9:50 PM - Aishwarya: I think she told about it to the therapist girl
10/23/24, 9:51 PM - Aishwarya: Coz the therapist girl acted more mature in the group after that
10/23/24, 9:52 PM - Aishwarya: Like I feel like she corrected her behavior a bit 
About hanging out with that other guy ( atleast about telling about it in group )
10/23/24, 9:53 PM - Aishwarya: Like it's not a regular relationship drama
That and all I don't really care 
Coz I don't even know that girl
10/23/24, 9:53 PM - Aishwarya: But since she is therapist, I became bit interested in how she behaved 
Like a bit
10/23/24, 9:53 PM - Aishwarya: This is not to say therapy is not effective 
It is
10/23/24, 9:55 PM - Aishwarya: But like a person themself is the one who can change their life and emotions the most 
Like ofcourse
10/23/24, 9:55 PM - Aishwarya: So like , whatever works for you ,you have to find that and do that , in terms of mental health
10/23/24, 9:56 PM - Aishwarya: Idk what type of problems you are going through 
Also ,its better to not discuss or reveal your personal problems to anyone 
That one is better to be reserved for the therapist
10/23/24, 9:58 PM - Aishwarya: Depends on the kind of personal problems and insecurities 
Most people have it 
But to different degrees 
Don't tell about it to anyone 
Like even when you get a girlfriend
Better to not tell her also 
Maybe if it's a wife 
Then probably can say , that idk
10/23/24, 9:59 PM - Aishwarya: If any parent is that caring and trustable 
Can tell them 
Trust the intuition about it 
Whether to say or not say
10/23/24, 9:59 PM - Aishwarya: But like other problems, it can help ease the mind to talk about it to friends etc
10/23/24, 10:00 PM - Aishwarya: Deep secrets have chance of leaking ,so that's the reason it's advised not to share 
Except with therapist 
Coz there is legal side etc
10/23/24, 10:01 PM - Aishwarya: These kind of problems if you want to share ,I can listen 
I think its better to share with your online friends ( if it's some conflict with someone irl )
10/24/24, 7:33 PM - Aishwarya: Hey
10/24/24, 7:33 PM - Aishwarya: How are you today ?
10/24/24, 7:33 PM - Aishwarya: Hope you are fine today
10/24/24, 7:34 PM - Aishwarya: Btw you replied yesterday 
Like reply only if you are free okay
10/24/24, 7:34 PM - Aishwarya: Otherwise it is okay
10/24/24, 7:36 PM - Aishwarya: I want to be friends with you because you are so good person
So like if you are buzy , no need to reply
10/24/24, 7:37 PM - Aishwarya: Like as long as you are a good person, I want to be friends with you 
Such people are not common
10/24/24, 7:39 PM - Aishwarya: And also when you are not buzy , I would appreciate if you spend time and listen to me in times of a need 
And vice versa
10/24/24, 7:40 PM - Aishwarya: But this semester you are buzy you told 
So I understand
10/24/24, 7:41 PM - Aishwarya: Plus I don't have any problems etc much 
Especially to share 
As of now 
These days
10/24/24, 7:43 PM - Aishwarya: Also reminding you again that , if you want to talk about any stressors or conflicts etc , count me too 
I can listen 
Idk if it helps you though 
But just said
10/24/24, 7:47 PM - Aishwarya: Like life incidents in which you are not the one in the wrong , atleast from my subjective pov
( but that's easy coz you are not a bad person ) 

Except that feel free to talk about anything okay
10/24/24, 7:49 PM - Aishwarya: Like don't feel like you will be disturbing me or anything 
I'm your listener friend
10/24/24, 7:50 PM - Aishwarya: I like being listener friend in general
10/24/24, 7:50 PM - Aishwarya: But not everyone deserves being listened to
10/24/24, 7:51 PM - Aishwarya: Okay bye 🥹
10/24/24, 7:51 PM - Aishwarya: Continue with your day
10/24/24, 7:51 PM - Aishwarya: Wishing you a good day today and tomorrow
10/24/24, 7:53 PM - Aishwarya: You are a good person , you deserve to be happy 
Always remind yourself of that okay 
If someone or like something disturbs your peace of mind ,or annoy you , trust that it will pass 
You will return to being alright and fine 😊
10/24/24, 8:07 PM - Aishwarya: Hey ,also I just noticed something
10/24/24, 8:07 PM - Aishwarya: Like where did your instagram go ?
You deactivated it temporarily?
10/24/24, 8:07 PM - Aishwarya: You alright right?
10/24/24, 8:08 PM - Aishwarya: What happened?
10/24/24, 8:08 PM - Aishwarya: Anything happened?
10/24/24, 8:08 PM - Aishwarya: Just to focus more on studies right ?
10/24/24, 8:11 PM - Aishwarya: But your second account is there
10/24/24, 8:12 PM - Aishwarya: I was gonna ask, why you didn't post the bus back ground pic and all ,in your main account also 
And the pics on your second account ,to post on main also 
Like colour pics 

But then I thought you are buzy right 
Probably that's why
10/24/24, 8:14 PM - Aishwarya: These are your younger days 
Should post maximum 
But just my opinion though
10/24/24, 8:14 PM - Aishwarya: I regret not posting
10/24/24, 8:14 PM - Aishwarya: Like not a major regret or anything but still
10/24/24, 8:15 PM - Aishwarya: In my college time, people did post ,but not as much
10/24/24, 8:15 PM - Aishwarya: Like I can post later also 
But like it's not the same yk
10/24/24, 8:18 PM - Aishwarya: Is it because of instagram likes reason that you are not posting much ?
Hope it's not annoying question or anything
10/24/24, 8:19 PM - Aishwarya: But like you have enough engagement in likes and comments 
So it's probably not that
10/24/24, 8:21 PM - Aishwarya: College times can be stressful 
Especially with classmates and all 
Like some will be friends 
And some are not 
On top of studies
10/24/24, 8:22 PM - Aishwarya: But you will look back and feel relaxed 
After you graduate
10/24/24, 8:23 PM - Aishwarya: Idk ,I just said because I felt like the reason is because of some problem in college or something like that
10/24/24, 8:24 PM - Aishwarya: Like imagine the problems you had in school times
Problem with some classmate or classmates there for example 

Its no more right
10/24/24, 8:25 PM - Aishwarya: You wish you had ignored some of those problems with them right 
Be more productive, have more fun etc right 
Similarly this also
10/24/24, 8:26 PM - Aishwarya: Its like try to see yourself in a time when you have already graduated 

Whatever college problem is no more, yk
10/24/24, 8:30 PM - Aishwarya: You must have seen those reels right 
Like people on their graduation day saying ,cant wait to block them 
Or block them all or something 💀
10/24/24, 8:30 PM - Aishwarya: And the comments saying relatable
10/24/24, 8:30 PM - Aishwarya: Like it's not uncommon
10/24/24, 8:32 PM - Aishwarya: Oh it's showing disabled
10/24/24, 8:32 PM - Aishwarya: So like instagram disabled your account right
10/24/24, 8:33 PM - Aishwarya: Idk
10/24/24, 8:34 PM - Aishwarya: Oh it's like you shared some post and it violated instagram policy ?
10/24/24, 8:34 PM - Aishwarya: Okay got it
10/24/24, 8:35 PM - Aishwarya: I thought you were sad and you yourself deactivated your main insta account temporarily
10/24/24, 8:36 PM - Aishwarya: But I hope insta didn't disable you for some sus activity 🫣
Like I'm curious now
10/24/24, 8:37 PM - Aishwarya: Also sometimes social media disables users for no proper reason also
10/24/24, 8:39 PM - Aishwarya: May you be able to retrieve your account soon 
Dw
10/24/24, 8:42 PM - Aishwarya: I think I will be bit sad too if it had happened to me
10/24/24, 8:43 PM - Aishwarya: Try to get it back
10/24/24, 8:44 PM - Aishwarya: You will get it back 
Especially if it's not a valid reason, then instagram will surely give your account back 
Don't worry
10/25/24, 7:32 PM - Aishwarya: Hey
10/25/24, 7:32 PM - Aishwarya: How are you today ?
10/25/24, 7:32 PM - Aishwarya: Hope you are fine
10/26/24, 9:48 AM - Sayanth: Depressed tho
10/26/24, 9:48 AM - Sayanth: How are u
10/26/24, 9:48 AM - Sayanth: Was tired last day that's why I couldn't reply
10/26/24, 9:49 AM - Sayanth: Also yeah it was me who deactivated not insta
10/26/24, 9:49 AM - Sayanth: I was depressed and all so that's why
10/26/24, 3:48 PM - Aishwarya: May I ask what's the reason ? 🙂
Is it due to BPD ?
Which makes you more sensitive
10/26/24, 3:49 PM - Aishwarya: Idk I just felt like ,yk looking from outside your life is nice 🥹
But I know it doesn't work like that
10/26/24, 3:49 PM - Aishwarya: I'm okay
10/26/24, 3:49 PM - Aishwarya: Its okay 
I understand
10/26/24, 3:50 PM - Aishwarya: Ohh :(
10/26/24, 3:51 PM - Aishwarya: Oh 
I hope you sort it out 
Like any problems and stress
10/26/24, 3:53 PM - Aishwarya: You don't have to say if you don't want to 

Is it because of people reasons ?

Do you want to talk about it ?

Like any problems in college you are facing?
With anyone
10/26/24, 3:55 PM - Aishwarya: You are like one the best persons I have met 
Character vise 
So I don't think its due to any conflict with other classmates or any other person/persons
10/26/24, 4:05 PM - Aishwarya: Can you send me the other IV pics too,on telegram ?
Like you told right you will ask your friends that day ,and then you got it right 
Those
10/26/24, 4:05 PM - Aishwarya: Like when you get free time
10/26/24, 4:06 PM - Aishwarya: And if it's okay to send 🙂
10/27/24, 6:45 PM - Aishwarya: Wow🤩

10/29/24, 8:01 PM - Sayanth: How did it go?
10/29/24, 8:01 PM - Aishwarya: It was easy
10/29/24, 8:02 PM - Aishwarya: Is it relative ?
10/29/24, 8:02 PM - Aishwarya: Who is that ?
10/29/24, 8:02 PM - Sayanth: Was it for learners or like driving test?
10/29/24, 8:02 PM - Sayanth: No a friend
10/29/24, 8:02 PM - Aishwarya: Oh learners
10/29/24, 8:02 PM - Aishwarya: Oh so another exam is there?
10/29/24, 8:02 PM - Aishwarya: Like theory one this was
10/29/24, 8:02 PM - Sayanth: I mean u gotta do practical to get driving license
10/29/24, 8:02 PM - Aishwarya: That's practical right 
Taking H
10/29/24, 8:03 PM - Sayanth: Yeah
10/29/24, 8:03 PM - Sayanth: And road test
10/29/24, 8:03 PM - Aishwarya: Yaaa

10/29/24, 8:03 PM - Aishwarya: With a teacher 
She gonna teach
10/29/24, 8:03 PM - Aishwarya: Yaa
10/29/24, 8:03 PM - Sayanth: Driving instructors tend to be a bit rude tho
10/29/24, 8:04 PM - Aishwarya: Actually njn atha udheshiche 
Maari poyi
10/29/24, 8:04 PM - Aishwarya: Oh 
I hope I pass
10/29/24, 8:04 PM - Aishwarya: This teacher is a woman
She is far relative kinda 
So I hope it goes well
10/29/24, 8:04 PM - Aishwarya: Ohhh 
I just saw
10/29/24, 8:05 PM - Aishwarya: 🥺
10/29/24, 8:05 PM - Aishwarya: Are you okay to talk about it ?
10/29/24, 8:05 PM - Aishwarya: Also are you buzy ?😅
10/29/24, 8:06 PM - Aishwarya: What happened
10/29/24, 8:06 PM - Sayanth: I don't wanna
10/29/24, 8:06 PM - Sayanth: Yeah
10/29/24, 8:06 PM - Aishwarya: Okay
10/29/24, 8:06 PM - Sayanth: Just got home
10/29/24, 8:06 PM - Aishwarya: Ya I understand 🥺
10/29/24, 8:06 PM - Sayanth: Gotta finish all my assignments and records tomorrow
10/29/24, 8:07 PM - Aishwarya: Okay
10/29/24, 8:16 PM - Aishwarya: Hey , I'm sorry to ask this 🥺
I didn't read that it was a friend at first ( I thought it was just a distant friend , like just someone you know )
10/29/24, 8:17 PM - Aishwarya: Like I didn't understand at first, fully
10/29/24, 8:19 PM - Aishwarya: Also, most of my friends have hurted me ( and my college best friend, who I really liked also 😢)
So I kind of don't know fully what it feels like
10/29/24, 8:19 PM - Aishwarya: I'm sorry 🥺
10/29/24, 8:22 PM - Aishwarya: Okay imma stop typing now 
This is not the time to explain
10/29/24, 8:24 PM - Aishwarya: If it's a good friend it can be very hurtful 
🥺
10/29/24, 8:24 PM - Aishwarya: Hope you feel okay soon
10/29/24, 9:29 PM - Aishwarya: I wanted to clarify about something 
Otherwise it will make me feel stupid ,like in my own mind 
I'm trying to built up my confidence 
About the rto exam thing
10/29/24, 9:29 PM - Aishwarya: https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.pavansgroup.rtoexam
10/29/24, 9:30 PM - Aishwarya: So like, there is this app
10/29/24, 9:30 PM - Aishwarya: That's why I told rto exam
10/29/24, 9:31 PM - Aishwarya: Also ,I know that there are two exams 
One theory 
And one practical 

The practical is the hard test 
The other one is easy that and all , I know
10/29/24, 9:36 PM - Aishwarya: I just meant today was theory one 

Like it's a 20 question exam ,so it's easy ofcourse
10/29/24, 9:36 PM - Aishwarya: But like I wanted to score 20/20 for some reason 
So I had studied like 5 hours plus for it
10/29/24, 9:37 PM - Aishwarya: To show my parents 

Like my brother got driving license without teaching
10/29/24, 9:40 PM - Aishwarya: And today , I finished the exam first 
After that , unfortunately there was some lag in internet 
So like the four others had to wait 
And I could go
10/29/24, 9:41 PM - Aishwarya: Like many of my classmates who were less good than me in studies have like overtaken me in studies

One reason is coz they have less trauma
10/29/24, 9:42 PM - Aishwarya: Idk it's something that's bit triggering for me 
Like someone making me feel stupid
10/29/24, 9:42 PM - Aishwarya: I know you didn't mean it like that
10/29/24, 9:42 PM - Aishwarya: Like it was just accidental
10/29/24, 9:43 PM - Aishwarya: But like ,I just wanted to say
10/29/24, 9:45 PM - Aishwarya: Also, idk what's the point of saying this
10/29/24, 9:46 PM - Aishwarya: For a moment ,I felt like you meant that driving practical is difficult exam 
And I'm not smart to do it or something 
Like easily
10/29/24, 9:46 PM - Aishwarya: But yea, you didn't mean like that at all
10/29/24, 9:48 PM - Aishwarya: But like long ago ,you did say something like that 
But accidentally
10/29/24, 9:48 PM - Aishwarya: This🙂
10/29/24, 9:50 PM - Aishwarya: I just wanted to say that if some day, I'm no longer friends with you ( if these kind of stuff happen repeatedly)

That's because you are not a good friend to me, like I'm to you
10/29/24, 9:51 PM - Aishwarya: Yk like you literally don't even reply to me properly
10/29/24, 9:52 PM - Aishwarya: And you replying after a long time , today 
And you made me feel kinda stupid 

Like not your mistake 
Coz it's accidental
10/29/24, 9:53 PM - Aishwarya: But like did I ever made any accidental mistakes even 
No
10/29/24, 9:53 PM - Aishwarya: With most of my friendships it's like that 
😒
10/29/24, 9:54 PM - Aishwarya: Like I'm friends with you coz I feel you are so good person 
Please don't ruin that 
Like i know it's accidental 
But still
10/29/24, 9:55 PM - Aishwarya: And I can't even cut you off or anything 
Coz you have always been good to me
10/29/24, 9:56 PM - Aishwarya: Except like rarely accidentally 🤔
10/29/24, 9:57 PM - Aishwarya: And I actually feel bad that I have doubts about such a good friend as you 😭
10/29/24, 9:58 PM - Aishwarya: Idk I just wanted to say that if I feel like ,someone I'm friends with , is not supportive of me 
I usually cut them off 
Just like that
10/29/24, 9:59 PM - Aishwarya: Friends are supposed to be supportive right
10/29/24, 10:00 PM - Aishwarya: Like even if someone is stupid, their friend is not supposed to bring it up 

Goes for everything 
Looks , money , anything
10/29/24, 10:01 PM - Aishwarya: You have always been so supportive, that's why I consider you one of my favorite friends
10/29/24, 10:04 PM - Aishwarya: So like, I think its just me overthinking 
And not you intentionally wanting to make me feel stupid 

Like that can't be the case
10/29/24, 10:06 PM - Aishwarya: Like rarely , I have felt like , you faked being a good friend to me 

But like there is no reason for you to do that
10/29/24, 10:09 PM - Aishwarya: But like I'm also a good friend 
So ofcourse, a neutral person is gonna be a good friend back 
Except haters
10/29/24, 10:09 PM - Aishwarya: So like you are actually a good friend 
Can't be otherwise
10/29/24, 10:10 PM - Aishwarya: Yk that kolkata friend ,he kind of insulted me a week back 😒

Like I know exactly to hurt him back 
But like I have never ever done it
10/29/24, 10:11 PM - Aishwarya: He has done it before also 
A few times
10/29/24, 10:11 PM - Aishwarya: Some of my friends have done this 
But whenever I do the same back 
Boom 
They are gone 😭
10/29/24, 10:13 PM - Aishwarya: And like he's also gone lol
But like I didn't even say anything about him  

Its just he felt indirectly offended or something 
Like he couldn't even handle that
10/29/24, 10:16 PM - Aishwarya: Like idk 
I know its just online friends 
But knowing that so many people are haters is not a good feeling 😭
10/29/24, 10:17 PM - Aishwarya: Like I'm trying to be a good person 

I'm already a good person 
Its just that some people bring out my bad sides
10/29/24, 10:17 PM - Aishwarya: And I'm self aware and I know who I can be a good friend to 
So I only befriend such people
10/29/24, 10:19 PM - Aishwarya: Like for example ,i told you right, I don't like dark skinned guys dating fair girls 
Like it's my major trauma 
So I can't be friends with them
10/29/24, 10:20 PM - Aishwarya: Like most or atleast many dark skinned guys, date their similar skin colour range girls only 

But like there is a possibility
10/29/24, 10:21 PM - Aishwarya: So like if I'm friends with someone 
I want good things for them 

Atleast I don't want to be hater
10/29/24, 10:23 PM - Aishwarya: Today at exam place ,I was trying to make friends with a girl who was my similar skin tone , not bad looking 
Plus kinda nice looking to me
10/29/24, 10:24 PM - Aishwarya: Her mom's place is near my home 
But like she got married of to husband's place 
So it's not so near
10/29/24, 10:24 PM - Aishwarya: Plus she is college going girl 
So making friends and all is not really possible 
Like not easy
10/29/24, 10:24 PM - Aishwarya: But like that is my vibe for girl friendships
10/29/24, 10:27 PM - Aishwarya: And like, I have told you right 
I root for you because you are a good person 
And because you are a fair guy 

( I hope it's not coming off as immature or anything 
But I have said this many times 
Because of my trauma, I can't wish dark skin guys well with few exceptions )
10/29/24, 10:28 PM - Aishwarya: So like because you are a fair guy 
I don't care who you date 

Like, because it's not related to my trauma
10/29/24, 10:28 PM - Aishwarya: Like I don't care if you date a fair girl/ girls itself
10/29/24, 10:29 PM - Aishwarya: Coz you are fair yourself right
10/29/24, 10:30 PM - Aishwarya: Ya but if you date brown skin girl/girls,  I will root for you more 

In the sense ,I will feel grateful and all

Coz in my observations and life experiences , most fair guys ( atleast in India and kerala), do think they all that 
(If they are even a tiny bit cute also )
10/29/24, 10:33 PM - Aishwarya: But girls, not really 
Coz like girls are being used to being judged on their beauty 
So like presence of fair skin , for girls,  is not really a positive , it's more of a standard 

But lack of fair skin in girls is a negative
10/29/24, 10:34 PM - Aishwarya: Hope your ego is not on roof 
After me saying all this 💀🥹
10/29/24, 10:36 PM - Aishwarya: Also you are an upper caste kind of guy right 
And you are not vanity type of it 
( but i think caste is not much of thing in kerala ,outside of who people marry into )
10/29/24, 10:37 PM - Aishwarya: But still outside of marriage section also, it is a thing
10/29/24, 10:37 PM - Aishwarya: Like kind of
10/29/24, 10:37 PM - Aishwarya: In the sense , how people show off money for example
10/29/24, 10:39 PM - Aishwarya: But like this, I know some other people also who are like that 
I told one crush guy right 
I had found out about him later ,that he is bit upper caste 
Plus like he is literally ending this bloodline ( like he doesn't want kids ,atleast presently )
That's means he is not overly in vanity of his caste
10/29/24, 10:42 PM - Aishwarya: But like caste is not a thing in terms of relationship if people date in same caste 
Like there are enough people from their own castes
10/29/24, 10:47 PM - Aishwarya: Like my first crush in college ,who I proposed 
Like he was my caste ,my skin tone and just two inches taller than me 
I'm like 5'2
And facially its kind of same ,like my face is kind of nice too
And parents occupation vise etc is also same 
And economically also 
Same age ( even though guys tend to be older by two years or so; but same age is also common  )
Like in not a single thing he is more than me
10/29/24, 10:48 PM - Aishwarya: And like a girl who is upper caste chose him 
And so he didn't choose me 
And she was fair
10/29/24, 10:51 PM - Aishwarya: So like things that are the reason, why I'm the way I'm 
Which is valid 
From a moral standpoint 

Like I can, not wish well ,for people who are trauma for me
10/29/24, 10:52 PM - Aishwarya: So I know who I can be good friend to 
So I only befriend such people
10/29/24, 10:53 PM - Aishwarya: But like some people will remain friends and be lowkey a hater 
Like why 😒
10/29/24, 10:53 PM - Aishwarya: This guy was like that
10/29/24, 10:53 PM - Aishwarya: Some others too
10/29/24, 10:54 PM - Aishwarya: But this was my recent loss of friend
10/29/24, 10:56 PM - Aishwarya: My pune friend had told to block him, after I told her that he is someone who is too much into caste
Like that too in a victim mindset way
10/29/24, 10:57 PM - Aishwarya: But she herself is a hater lowkey , so he was more reliable friend comparatively 
Like atleast he has listened to me 
In the beginning I didn't know what kind of a person he actually was
10/29/24, 11:00 PM - Aishwarya: He's a hater, so I'm not friends with him anymore
10/29/24, 11:01 PM - Aishwarya: Like he said something which triggered me 
It had happened like twice before, but I had forgiven him
10/29/24, 11:03 PM - Aishwarya: In the beginning , he had told he had joined engineering 

But he didn't, it was another course
10/29/24, 11:04 PM - Aishwarya: I think he wanted to make it seem like he had some brains ,idk
10/29/24, 11:04 PM - Aishwarya: There are some related things ,but I have never ever made him feel bad about it
10/29/24, 11:05 PM - Aishwarya: And it's not like I can say something about it
10/29/24, 11:06 PM - Aishwarya: But like still
10/29/24, 11:07 PM - Aishwarya: Plus his ex did actual engineering
10/29/24, 11:08 PM - Aishwarya: I feel he is kinda insecure about it
10/29/24, 11:09 PM - Aishwarya: Plus he is kinda insecure about how much his job pays and is frustrated about it
10/29/24, 11:10 PM - Aishwarya: Like he has never told all this 
But anyone can understand
10/29/24, 11:11 PM - Aishwarya: And also it's kinda cheap to say about things like this 😭

But it's like he can say anything
10/29/24, 11:14 PM - Aishwarya: Losing bad people is not a loss 
But like it's altering my brain chemistry 
And I'm trying to a good person
10/29/24, 11:15 PM - Aishwarya: Like what he said is kind of a big insult
10/29/24, 11:18 PM - Aishwarya: Plus there are a lot of instances where he was lowkey and highkey a hater
10/29/24, 11:19 PM - Aishwarya: He told that one of my favorite actress avantika, she looks like a frog 
To me she is kinda hot ,little bit 
Atleast the roles she play
10/29/24, 11:20 PM - Aishwarya: She is the brown girl representation abroad
10/29/24, 11:21 PM - Aishwarya: In bollywood etc, brown girl representation, its not there already
10/29/24, 11:24 PM - Aishwarya: And another girl charithra chandran, she got caster in one piece anime 
He didn't like that 
Like how is it effecting his life lol
10/29/24, 11:24 PM - Aishwarya: https://www.instagram.com/reel/C_M0PCEouMD/?igsh=NGU2bnVsOGNzcWx2
10/29/24, 11:27 PM - Aishwarya: And even my best friend from college , she doesn't follow an influencer girl who was our classmate ,who is dark skinned 
But she follows a fair girl influencer who was classmate 

Like that's not supportive friend vibe
10/29/24, 11:28 PM - Aishwarya: But atleast she hasn't insulted me or anything 
Like she don't make unnecessarily hate comments
10/29/24, 11:31 PM - Aishwarya: I remember you saying you like tanned skin girls like jessica alba 
Like I think that skin tone is kinda like medium fair, in terms of india
Like the skin tone you like most
10/29/24, 11:32 PM - Aishwarya: But like you know how to support a friend
10/29/24, 11:33 PM - Aishwarya: Like it's not that difficult thing to do
10/29/24, 11:34 PM - Aishwarya: But some people want to be hater unnecessarily
10/29/24, 11:34 PM - Aishwarya: There are many instances like that 
I can't recall which all 
Which made me think you are not a hater
10/29/24, 11:35 PM - Aishwarya: So coz of that some minor misunderstanding, I feel it's like my overthinking 
Like you didn't mean it
10/29/24, 11:36 PM - Aishwarya: But like if I ever feel like you are like that too ,I'm gonna cut you off
10/29/24, 11:37 PM - Aishwarya: Like you are actually not a hater or anything 
I kinda feel bad for saying that as a scenario
10/29/24, 11:40 PM - Aishwarya: Coz what if it annoys you 
Its like I'm ruining the friendship with very few good friends I have left
10/29/24, 11:42 PM - Aishwarya: But like it's better to talk about things, rather than keeping it in mind and holding resentment
10/29/24, 11:45 PM - Aishwarya: Oh I have to say something else that I thought too 
But it's probably not true
10/29/24, 11:46 PM - Aishwarya: Like I feel you want to leave someone on read ,that's why you said you can message 
But you won't be able to reply 

Apart from you being buzy
10/29/24, 11:47 PM - Aishwarya: But like that and all I don't mind actually 
That's why I text you regardless
10/29/24, 11:50 PM - Aishwarya: And I felt like some people 
Probably some classmates you are not friends with ,they leave you on read
10/29/24, 11:52 PM - Aishwarya: But probably not ,since you told you are the one who don't engage with them 
Like you didn't go for onam function even though you got invited too right
10/29/24, 11:52 PM - Aishwarya: Its probably true only
10/29/24, 11:53 PM - Aishwarya: Idk but I felt like you take that out on me
10/29/24, 11:53 PM - Aishwarya: Again I'm sorry, you might not even have remotely any idea
10/29/24, 11:54 PM - Aishwarya: Like i just felt so ,that's all 
A little bit
10/29/24, 11:54 PM - Aishwarya: Not true
10/30/24, 12:02 AM - Aishwarya: I think you are a good person 
That's why I'm explaining all this 
Otherwise I just won't be friends with them anymore 

These messages are too many 
Sorry for that also
10/30/24, 12:04 AM - Aishwarya: Also, after driving classes start I will be tired from that 
I already get tired from traveling sort of things
10/30/24, 12:05 AM - Aishwarya: But I think I'm gonna message you everyday
Idk 
Except probably weekends
10/30/24, 12:06 AM - Aishwarya: But if I don't message much regularly, it's coz of that 
Okay 
( assuming that you do care about my friendship )
10/30/24, 12:07 AM - Aishwarya: Like please don't think its coz what all I told today 
But driving classes start after a week though
10/30/24, 12:08 AM - Aishwarya: Actually I told this today ,one reason is also , to remind you that why I consider you a good friend
10/30/24, 12:08 AM - Aishwarya: But also , if I don't feel like someone is a good friend, then I'm not friends with them anymore
10/30/24, 12:08 AM - Aishwarya: But like not related to you 
I was saying generally
10/30/24, 12:14 AM - Aishwarya: I had thought that I'm not gonna send you long paragraphs anymore 
But like today this rto thing happened and I had to explain a lot 😓 ( I hope something like that don't happen again)
And then it turned into so many other ranting 😭
10/30/24, 12:18 AM - Aishwarya: Oh but previously sometimes, it was advices for you ( the long paragraphs)
So it most probably was not annoying ,I hope 
In the sense ,you don't need it ,coz most people already knows advices
10/30/24, 12:19 AM - Aishwarya: But like such long paragraphs, I will send 
Sometimes 

Like not advice
But how someone will console irl
10/30/24, 12:21 AM - Aishwarya: The annoying long paragraphs I won't send anymore 
I promise 
I hope something like today won't happen accidentally again 🙂

It might make me not want to text you anymore at all 😭
Coz my energy is drained 
So I hope such accidents don't happen 

Please be more careful with words next time 🥺
10/30/24, 12:23 AM - Aishwarya: I message you everyday just to check up on you 
Because you are one of the few good persons I know 
So it betters my day knowing that there are good people in the world 
And that there is goodness in the world
10/30/24, 12:25 AM - Aishwarya: You are one of the symbolism for me that there are good kind of people around 💜
10/30/24, 12:30 AM - Aishwarya: Also , you have told right, you used to be listener friend of some friends of yours ( and you said that ,they didn't care about you or listen to you )
10/30/24, 12:31 AM - Aishwarya: How you were to those friends, that is the friendship part that I want from you
10/30/24, 12:33 AM - Aishwarya: Like ofcourse, I will listen to you as well 
But I feel you won't want anyone to listen to you 
Atleast not me 
Which is fine with me 
Like either ways 
But I do care about you ,so I would like to help, if I can
10/30/24, 12:33 AM - Aishwarya: But that was back when you were a people pleaser I think
10/30/24, 12:34 AM - Aishwarya: So I think I won't be getting that 🥲
10/30/24, 12:34 AM - Aishwarya: But that's okay
10/30/24, 12:34 AM - Aishwarya: I would want to be friends with you regardless
10/30/24, 12:37 AM - Aishwarya: Also, like I have one more doubt ,like why didn't you send me your pics 
Is it that you found a girlfriend 
So like you feel guilty sending your pics to some other girl ?
10/30/24, 12:40 AM - Aishwarya: Also, i think shouldn't ask for your pics again 
Coz I think it effect the dynamic of the friendship after you get a girlfriend 
Idk 
Like she might tell you to totally avoid such friends
10/30/24, 12:42 AM - Aishwarya: Like I have a hope that from next semester onwards, you will be less buzy 
And your time will be bit available for me also 🥺
Like not everyday ,some days 
Not even weekly or anything
10/30/24, 12:51 AM - Aishwarya: I think in friendships also, people have to want the same things, otherwise the friendship gradually dies 
For me ,I want online friend who I can share things that I can't talk to irl friends 
Plus they should be a good person ,otherwise it's not the same
10/30/24, 12:54 AM - Aishwarya: Like even if I get irl friends,  I would still want online friends 
In fact I feel I should have made online friends during college 
My mental health would have been bit more better then
10/30/24, 7:29 PM - Aishwarya: Hey
10/30/24, 7:29 PM - Aishwarya: How are you today ?
10/30/24, 7:29 PM - Aishwarya: I'm sorry for your loss 
Wishing you comfort during this difficult time
10/30/24, 7:30 PM - Aishwarya: Hope you feel okay soon
10/31/24, 7:34 PM - Aishwarya: Hey
10/31/24, 7:34 PM - Aishwarya: How are you today ?
10/31/24, 7:34 PM - Aishwarya: Hope you are fine and doing well
11/1/24, 7:38 PM - Aishwarya: Hey
11/1/24, 7:38 PM - Aishwarya: How are you today ?
11/1/24, 7:38 PM - Aishwarya: Hope you are fine and doing well
11/5/24, 8:30 PM - Sayanth: Hey
11/5/24, 8:30 PM - Sayanth: Sorry
11/5/24, 8:30 PM - Sayanth: I had exams
11/5/24, 8:30 PM - Sayanth: Got exam till 11th
11/5/24, 8:30 PM - Sayanth: And then final exams too
11/5/24, 8:30 PM - Sayanth: After 3 days
11/5/24, 8:30 PM - Sayanth: So ill be busy
11/5/24, 8:30 PM - Sayanth: Don't think I'm ignoring u
11/5/24, 8:30 PM - Sayanth: It's just I'm tooo exhausted mentally and physically
11/5/24, 8:31 PM - Sayanth: Also got fever again
11/5/24, 9:05 PM - Aishwarya: Hey🥹
11/5/24, 9:05 PM - Aishwarya: That's totally okay
11/5/24, 9:06 PM - Aishwarya: I mean I understand being buzy
11/5/24, 9:06 PM - Aishwarya: Oh okay
11/5/24, 9:06 PM - Aishwarya: Good luck
11/5/24, 9:06 PM - Aishwarya: Study well okay
11/5/24, 9:07 PM - Aishwarya: Okay 
Ya I kind of know that you aren't ignoring or anything
11/5/24, 9:08 PM - Aishwarya: Okay
11/5/24, 9:11 PM - Aishwarya: Yk like my kolkata friend , he called me today 
I just saw now 
( like he had last called on 22 nd october , and he said something insulting , but I let it go ;
And then he removed me from his insta follow)

But I told i will call later 
(Coz I want to reply to you )

You are like the friend I hope never lose 🥺
11/5/24, 9:12 PM - Aishwarya: Like in terms of girl friends, I have felt like sometimes they compete with me
11/5/24, 9:16 PM - Aishwarya: And in terms of guy friends , I have rarely felt like(the times when I logically thought about it) if I were more pretty , young etc etc , they would like me 
Or like me back 
Like hypothetically 

But like those are luxuries
Also studies is the main priority 
And I hope to move abroad
11/5/24, 9:18 PM - Aishwarya: Like some guys they can only be good to girls they like
11/5/24, 9:18 PM - Aishwarya: For example like my best friend in college , her ex boyfriend
11/5/24, 9:19 PM - Aishwarya: But most guys are not that extreme like him though
11/5/24, 9:20 PM - Aishwarya: You are like the only guy( especially from india ) who is good to everyone 
( as long as they don't annoy you or anything )
From what I have noticed
11/5/24, 9:22 PM - Aishwarya: I read this 
But forgot to reply to this 

I hope you get better soon 

Rest 
But also study well in other times okay
11/5/24, 9:23 PM - Aishwarya: Ya I understand 

Its like soo many things to do 
And soo less time 

And the tasks and studies are tiring also <This message was edited>
11/5/24, 9:30 PM - Aishwarya: <Media omitted>
11/5/24, 9:31 PM - Aishwarya: I have zero irl friends 
So I have like a very few online friends
11/5/24, 9:34 PM - Aishwarya: This guy have listened to me a few times 
Like my unpaid therapist 🥹💜
Its not that I don't go to therapy 
But it didn't really work for me
11/5/24, 9:35 PM - Aishwarya: That listening was mostly many months ago though
11/5/24, 9:35 PM - Aishwarya: Regardless I'm grateful
11/5/24, 9:35 PM - Aishwarya: But in reality I have also listened to him 
So it's not a one sided favor
11/5/24, 9:37 PM - Aishwarya: Like sometimes it was him talking bs about his stupid views that I have listened 
So it counts
11/5/24, 9:38 PM - Aishwarya: He was kinda annoying here and there sometimes
Not really anything directly insulting to me mostly though
11/5/24, 9:41 PM - Aishwarya: I don't have family to talk to mostly 
Plus no irl friends 
So because of no social interaction, taking to a person on call was good overall 
And I had told him that can call once a week
11/5/24, 9:42 PM - Aishwarya: Like he has already mean to me for no reason twice already 
In a span of months 
I had met him in December last year
11/5/24, 9:43 PM - Aishwarya: But like the last insult , I don't think I can be friends with him again 
I was never gonna message him again 
Coz I don't want haters disguised as friends
11/5/24, 9:45 PM - Aishwarya: I didn't block him because he would think that he is special for me to block him 
I was just disappointed that another friend turned out to be a hater , for no reason
11/5/24, 9:47 PM - Aishwarya: And I have told about some of my other friends also right
11/5/24, 9:48 PM - Aishwarya: And recently a few days ago I reconnected with an acquaintance 
A white guy from US 
He has a girlfriend 
Like I replied after many weeks 
I didn't have energy to reply coz I know he will be buzy , so he can't be an available friend in times of a needs 
Plus the time difference
11/5/24, 9:49 PM - Aishwarya: He send a voice note for the first time, simply 
I told I will send voice note later
11/5/24, 9:50 PM - Aishwarya: Like in one voice note , he was saying that he won't judge me unless I'm racist or something 
I forgot exactly what
11/5/24, 9:51 PM - Aishwarya: Like he's humble and sweet 
How can I be racist lol
11/5/24, 9:52 PM - Aishwarya: Like ofcourse there are a lot of racist white people as well
11/5/24, 9:52 PM - Aishwarya: But indian people being racist to their own people 
Like that just gives me the ick
11/5/24, 9:54 PM - Aishwarya: Like white people being racist , it's not an ick 
Coz like, in racist people pov ,they are anyways the top of the hierarchy
11/5/24, 9:54 PM - Aishwarya: But like they are not good people though
11/5/24, 9:58 PM - Aishwarya: In the mid of last year was the first time I started messaging people on reddit 
Probably more than hundred people 
One or more person ,almost everyday 
And it stopper last year end or so , mostly
11/5/24, 9:58 PM - Aishwarya: Idk if it's a biased pov 
Coz reddit is not real life
11/5/24, 9:59 PM - Aishwarya: But like Indian people are one of the most racist people ever
11/5/24, 10:00 PM - Aishwarya: In the sense ,it makes sense for white people to be racist 
Its not good ofcourse
11/5/24, 10:01 PM - Aishwarya: Also these people are reproducing like crazy 😓
For people who don't like themselves and are racist to each other 

Ofcourse not majority of the population is like that
11/5/24, 10:06 PM - Aishwarya: I lowkey feel frustrated that ,this will be the country that I also have to contribute to 
So I hope I can go abroad 
Like here also I have faced discrimination , from my own people
11/5/24, 10:08 PM - Aishwarya: And I myself not having kids 
One main reason is the skin colour
And guys, like my first crush in college, and my best from college's ex reproducing 
And many other dark skin guys like that 
Its not fair 
And also me having to work in such a country
11/5/24, 10:10 PM - Aishwarya: And like the fair guys having kids ,that I don't feel some type of way btw 
Like that's alright
11/5/24, 10:11 PM - Aishwarya: So like you , I will root for, regardless
11/5/24, 10:13 PM - Aishwarya: I mean like all fair guys or kinda fair guys 
Them having kids is alright
Regardless they are a good person or not
11/5/24, 10:14 PM - Aishwarya: I know there are a lot of other things that can create suffering for kid, and when they become adult
11/5/24, 10:17 PM - Aishwarya: But in my case, my skin colour was my primary suffering 
My life would have been so good otherwise 
Like I think I would look same or sometimes better,  than all the crushes , of all my crushes, in school and college ( like their crushes, and girls they dated , were just fair versions of me )
11/5/24, 10:20 PM - Aishwarya: And like some guys even directly commented on my looks,  when they look no better
11/5/24, 10:23 PM - Aishwarya: And then some girls 
They were also haters 
Like the fair girls for example ,  they think they should be prettier just coz they are fair 
Meanwhile some of them can't even put efforts to be not fat even
11/5/24, 10:24 PM - Aishwarya: And then the pretty fair girls , they always put some guy above the, friendship with other girls 
And then that guy itself disrespect them when some better girl comes along lol
11/5/24, 10:29 PM - Aishwarya: I have told my traumas and how it shaped the way I think to some people 
Only some of them have understood it
11/5/24, 10:32 PM - Aishwarya: Like my pune friend and delhi friend ,both girls 
They have understood 
But my delhi friend was kinda stupidly competitive for no reason 
And like my pune friend, she is good to me, but she is very hateful to people who have kids 
So I don't feel safe with her 
Like when I told about my problems to her ,I felt like she is just happy that her view that people shouldn't have kids is reinforced and that is what she care about
11/5/24, 10:33 PM - Aishwarya: Like she would like me less , if I'm i don't have enough struggles 
Coz then she fears that I will have kids 
That is the vibe of her
11/5/24, 10:34 PM - Aishwarya: Like you are the only friend I have who is not like this 🥹
11/5/24, 10:35 PM - Aishwarya: I know people who are good from online , but we are not friends 
Mostly acquaintances or just strangers
11/5/24, 10:36 PM - Aishwarya: And even though you don't agree with my views, mostly 
You haven't judged me 🥺
11/5/24, 10:44 PM - Aishwarya: You are like that much good friend
11/5/24, 10:44 PM - Aishwarya: So if you are buzy for a long time, no time to reply etc 
Or anything like that 
I will still want to be friends
11/5/24, 10:44 PM - Aishwarya: I will still be friends
11/5/24, 10:45 PM - Aishwarya: Like you don't have reply on any day , if you don't have time for example
11/5/24, 10:47 PM - Aishwarya: In fact it will be better, if we can still be friends regardless 
Coz friendship is not measured by the amount of time spend together
11/5/24, 10:50 PM - Aishwarya: But I hope that when and if you get less buzy, next semester ,you will have more time 
And give some time for me also , when I text you 
But mainly in times of need 
Coz I don't have any good friends 🥺
Where are the good people
They are probably rare
11/5/24, 10:53 PM - Aishwarya: I think I used to text, like EVERYDAY , for three months 
And you used to reply often 
In fact you were messaging too
11/5/24, 10:53 PM - Aishwarya: So like thats not needed
11/5/24, 10:56 PM - Aishwarya: But like it was good ,and
I think coz of that , I got to become close friends with you 
Plus it was nice messaging you often 
Even though, now that I think of it , it was a loottt of time
11/5/24, 10:57 PM - Aishwarya: It was much needed interactions in a way , coz online friendship take more time to built
11/5/24, 10:57 PM - Aishwarya: In irl , people hangout ,and if they vibe 
Boom they are friends
11/5/24, 10:58 PM - Aishwarya: And the vibe needn't even be there 
They can just simply hangout and be friends
11/5/24, 11:00 PM - Aishwarya: Also too much messaging , and everyday messaging, kind of friendship is not easy to sustain
11/5/24, 11:01 PM - Aishwarya: Especially in a transition , when you get a girlfriend
11/5/24, 11:01 PM - Aishwarya: Like do you understand the pov
11/5/24, 11:03 PM - Aishwarya: So like plz don't think that , more time spend is more good friends
11/5/24, 11:04 PM - Aishwarya: Plus you don't have much time now anyways right 
So yea you understand
11/5/24, 11:05 PM - Aishwarya: But I just said
11/6/24, 10:22 PM - Aishwarya: Hey 
Hope you are fine and doing well 
Do you have exam tomorrow?
Good luck for the upcoming exam 
Study well , revise everything well 

Don't feel anxious okayyyy 

You got thiss 
You are talented and intelligent 

Believe in yourself 😇
11/16/24, 8:30 PM - Aishwarya: Hey 
Hope your studies are going well 

Is your exams getting over on 3rd December?
I'm gonna message you then when your exams are over 
Hope you are less buzy then and will reply to me 
Please give some time for me also okay 

You are one of the understanding and empathetic persons ever
I feel lucky to have a friend like you 

Its like, not so good friends and people makes me understand more ,how valuable the good persons are 
Why can't there be more such good people
11/16/24, 8:32 PM - Aishwarya: One girl who follows me , something happened with her also 
Like nothing major 
I had this urge to no longer be friends with her 
But then I got reminded that I don't really have much good friends to do so
11/16/24, 8:33 PM - Aishwarya: A week back, she asked some personal question 
Its obvious, idk why to ask like that 
But I don't really mind though
11/16/24, 8:34 PM - Aishwarya: Its a small thing, but still 
Its the principles
11/16/24, 8:36 PM - Aishwarya: Like she knows that I'm not on good terms with my dad
11/16/24, 8:38 PM - Aishwarya: And last week she was like ' if you don't mind me asking,  how do u manage your personal expenses, I mean I feel guilty to ask my parents for money' 

Then after some replies ,she said ' I remember you telling me you don't share a strong relationship with ur dad. Sry if it's too personal'
11/16/24, 8:39 PM - Aishwarya: I don't really mind the question in itself 
But she asking me like that ,didn't feel right
11/16/24, 8:40 PM - Aishwarya: She don't have a job for five months because the jobs weren't paying enough 
So she is looking for a better job opportunity 
Which and all is totally valid
11/16/24, 8:43 PM - Aishwarya: She has a good bond with her dad 
Plus some days ago she had shared a story 'I'm so proud to be my father's daughter'
11/16/24, 8:46 PM - Aishwarya: I don't usually open her story , just sometimes 
And those times I always like the story , especially if she posts her pics 
This story also I liked 
And I'm happy for her ,that she has a good dad ( especially since I consider her my friend )
11/16/24, 8:47 PM - Aishwarya: I haven't even told her what's the issue I have with my dad 
Like it's okay now 
But I haven't told her any details 
One reason is coz I don't want more people to know 
Plus it's in the past
11/16/24, 8:49 PM - Aishwarya: And yesterday I was talking to her about something 
And I told her something I'm proud of ( not something directly related to me but kind of)

And then I thought maybe I came across as overly proud of it and then to minimize it I kind of added a text to depreciate it 
Just in case she don't feel accidentally
11/16/24, 8:50 PM - Aishwarya: She didn't reply anything to the part where i was proud of 
But she replied 'yup' to the part where I talked bit negatively 
Wth
11/16/24, 8:51 PM - Aishwarya: Like it doesn't matter, coz what someone think or say is just opinion 
It may or may not be facts 
And also that person saying doesn't really matter , apart from what that says about the person and the friendship
11/16/24, 8:52 PM - Aishwarya: Like she don't care about me, like I care about her 
Its not like I really really care about her or anything 
But atleast the basics is there ,I'm sure
11/16/24, 8:54 PM - Aishwarya: Its not like she don't require online friends either 
Few months ago ,she had posted something about her irl friends 
Like some reel ,like about being betrayed by friends 
Can't remember exactly
11/16/24, 8:55 PM - Aishwarya: And yesterday she reached out to me , coz she was kinda depressed 
Her irl bsf was working 
And she wanted to talk to a friend
11/16/24, 8:57 PM - Aishwarya: Like it's always good to have people to talk to when we are stressed, depressed etc
11/16/24, 9:00 PM - Aishwarya: Long ago, I saw that she liked a reel , and like I wanted to ask if she got into a relationship 
Like I just got curious lol 
But I didn't ask her ,especially since she is a girl 
Like she is someone religious also
11/16/24, 9:03 PM - Aishwarya: Coz i don't want to create any weird energy and let it effect the friendship 
Sometimes small things can cause resentment
11/16/24, 9:04 PM - Aishwarya: But she didn't think twice before asking me unnecessarily question
And saying what could have been avoided 
Like being nice is not that difficult
11/16/24, 9:09 PM - Aishwarya: This is not really a vent 
Although I'm bit disappointed in her
11/16/24, 9:13 PM - Aishwarya: Just wanted to say why you are the only friend who hasn't really disappointed me 
( you have rarely, but like that was over a span of a long time ,and you have supported me so much )

Also you didn't get annoyed or defensive when i told you about it 
Like you understood 
And you didn't do it intentionally 
Like more than actions, the intentions matter 
That's why I always want to be friends with you 
Atleast till I get a good friend like you
11/16/24, 9:16 PM - Aishwarya: I met an acquaintance who is into altruistic stuff 
But I feel that the guys who do it , do it to get laid
11/16/24, 9:17 PM - Aishwarya: He said that there are girls and guys he know who do such stuff 
It's good to know that there are good people
11/16/24, 9:18 PM - Aishwarya: But I don't think any of them would want to be friends with me
11/16/24, 9:19 PM - Aishwarya: I don't think I can do altruistic stuff in future also 
I do care about people, but only the ones who I know are kinda good
11/16/24, 9:21 PM - Aishwarya: So it doesn't make sense , how people can be into it
11/16/24, 9:23 PM - Aishwarya: Especially guys
I thought they mostly do things, only to get girls out of their league 
Or to get laid with many girls 
But such rare guys exist who are good 
But I don't think this guy is that , coz all he mentioned was few girl friends 
What happened to having guy friends also 
Idk
11/16/24, 9:28 PM - Aishwarya: Anyways, what I meant is ,in your case ,I know that you are not a guy who does things to score girls yk
11/16/24, 9:31 PM - Aishwarya: Like you want a relationship 
That is different 
I meant like scoring girls thing 
Oh and you didn't even blame that girl who was kinda not so good to you
11/16/24, 9:32 PM - Aishwarya: Usually guys are more mad at such stuff than girls 
And then they really hate women 
But yea you a straight guy and girls are not that bad in character,  so it makes sense you are not blaming
11/16/24, 9:33 PM - Aishwarya: Idk just wanted to say that you are a good person 
And good people are not easy to come across
11/16/24, 9:35 PM - Aishwarya: And also becoming friends with 
Coz good people existing doesn't mean we find them often 
Or they want to be friends
11/16/24, 9:40 PM - Aishwarya: But even after your exams, if you don't reply, it means you don't want to be friends 
But I will message until you actually say that, you don't have time to be friends with me 
Coz you are probably actually buzy 
You are buzy now, that I know, coz of exams
11/16/24, 9:41 PM - Aishwarya: So I hope you will reply after your exams
11/24/24, 10:09 PM - Sayanth: Heyyyy
11/24/24, 10:09 PM - Sayanth: How are u?
11/24/24, 10:09 PM - Sayanth: Sorry for not replying
11/24/24, 10:09 PM - Sayanth: Exams aren't over
11/24/24, 10:09 PM - Sayanth: But still
11/24/24, 10:10 PM - Sayanth: Sorry I was also not in a good mental state to text anyone or have conversation that's why
11/24/24, 10:16 PM - Aishwarya: Heyyy 🥹
11/24/24, 10:16 PM - Aishwarya: I'm finee
11/24/24, 10:16 PM - Aishwarya: Its okayy
11/24/24, 10:16 PM - Aishwarya: Its okay , I totally understand 🥹
11/24/24, 10:17 PM - Aishwarya: Study welll
11/24/24, 10:20 PM - Aishwarya: You have nice eyelashes🥹
11/24/24, 10:21 PM - Aishwarya: I wanted to send a study related reel on insta 
But idk if it will be useful or not 
Pinne I thought not to disturb 
I think I will send here
11/24/24, 10:23 PM - Aishwarya: Pinne don't think about ex or any college people etc okay 
Like don't worry about such stuff 
Especially during exam times
11/24/24, 10:25 PM - Aishwarya: Also , think of the time in future, where you have already overcome it 
Like in past you had some problems,  you overcame that , for example 
In that way

11/24/24, 10:35 PM - Aishwarya: Like not that useful 
But like study vibes kinda thing
11/24/24, 10:36 PM - Aishwarya: https://youtu.be/WPni755-Krg?si=1lPGccitLO9NxnCx
11/24/24, 10:51 PM - Aishwarya: Bhaki ulla days important aanu 
But exam before ulle day very important aanu 
And while giving the exam 
Have confidence 
Believe in yourself okay 
You can do this
11/24/24, 11:28 PM - Aishwarya: https://www.instagram.com/reel/C9IGcH0IXv_/?igsh=bWVqdDh2ZmRlODZ1
11/24/24, 11:29 PM - Aishwarya: https://www.instagram.com/reel/C8119NDudGN/?igsh=MXU4a3Q4Zzd1a3Rw
11/24/24, 11:30 PM - Aishwarya: In this he is saying in words
11/24/24, 11:32 PM - Aishwarya: Its like, we know such stuff already,  for the most part 
But like when someone advices something, with confidence in their words , that it worked for them ,it hit different 
Idk for me it's like that 
So I save such stuff
11/24/24, 11:33 PM - Aishwarya: The reel that I wanted to send previously was two others 
One is scribbling method 
And other is walking while studying ( sometimes )
Especially when we feel sleepy and all
11/24/24, 11:34 PM - Aishwarya: https://www.instagram.com/reel/DBesJXGMtas/?igsh=MXRyZTZjdDd2bWZleA==
11/24/24, 11:36 PM - Aishwarya: But can do with non dominant hand too 
I used to do this before seeing the reels on it 
It helps me concentrate more 

But like some people just read passively even and retain everything 
Lucky peoples
11/24/24, 11:37 PM - Aishwarya: Like it might not work for you okay 
Maybe idk 
In which case ignore it
But you can try though
11/24/24, 11:39 PM - Aishwarya: Sometimes i gatekeep stuff 
Even though it might not be useful at all lol 
I only tell to friends 
So that's why I felt like sending
11/24/24, 11:40 PM - Aishwarya: https://www.instagram.com/reel/C6_TqXkhGIl/?igsh=MTZudmdsNTl0dDM3ag==
11/24/24, 11:41 PM - Aishwarya: Ithile first one
11/24/24, 11:42 PM - Aishwarya: I used to walk and study 
And then scribbling method 
And music tunes  
And then after learning that those are a thing, it helped me more

11/25/24, 12:10 AM - Aishwarya: Also, I hope you become bit free after all your exams 🥺
11/25/24, 12:11 AM - Aishwarya: Everyone's life will be more better if they have a good friend who is available for them as well
11/25/24, 12:26 AM - Aishwarya: Like vellapozhum korch time mathi 
I hope you will consider it 🥺
But ipol thanne you don't have time,  so gf okke set aayi kazhiyumbol ottum time kaanulla

11/25/24, 12:26 AM - Aishwarya: I will message after your exams 😊 <This message was edited>
2/6/25, 8:44 AM - Aishwarya: Hi
2/6/25, 8:45 AM - Aishwarya: Did you block me on instagram?🤔
2/6/25, 8:45 AM - Aishwarya: At first I didn't understand 
I thought you just removed me
2/6/25, 8:53 AM - Aishwarya: And I kept on sending you messages 
Till 3 am or so 🥲
2/6/25, 8:55 AM - Aishwarya: Did you receive the messages?
When did you block me ?
2/6/25, 8:56 AM - Aishwarya: I was like telling about many things 
Including asking why you had removed me
2/6/25, 9:00 AM - Aishwarya: Is it because you are afraid I will message your followers or something?
But you didn't block from your other account 
Maybe it's because the other account people are close ,and you feel confident that nothing will happen I someone message them 
I remember you telling that , that pinterest girl messaged your followers
2/6/25, 9:01 AM - Aishwarya: I explained about that also so much
2/6/25, 9:01 AM - Aishwarya: I will copy paste it here later
2/6/25, 9:01 AM - Aishwarya: I want to get ready to go somewhere
2/6/25, 9:03 AM - Aishwarya: <Media omitted>
2/6/25, 9:05 AM - Aishwarya: I even felt like you send me that reel , and then I will say to not send reels now 
And you making that an excuse to remove me 
Like you doing all that just to remove me 
Its probably not like that
2/6/25, 9:06 AM - Aishwarya: Imagine how bad I felt
2/6/25, 9:06 AM - Aishwarya: I was like living peacefully
2/6/25, 9:08 AM - Aishwarya: And yesterday I slept past 3 am 
And like then I was bit crying for a minute or so 
Then somehow I fell asleep soon itself
2/6/25, 9:09 AM - Aishwarya: And I had said sorry also 
About some things I said in January
2/6/25, 9:11 AM - Aishwarya: But that I explained back then itself 
And like I was bit hurt during that time
2/6/25, 9:11 AM - Aishwarya: That's why also
2/6/25, 9:14 AM - Aishwarya: Like you have to unblock me and accept my request on instagram 🥲
Its your wish but still
2/6/25, 9:14 AM - Aishwarya: Like what did I even do
2/6/25, 9:18 AM - Aishwarya: And I don't know why your whatsapp pfp is this for a long while 
Is it to make it seem like this is true ? 
And to make it seem like you care about me as a friend?
2/6/25, 9:21 AM - Aishwarya: But if you do care , you would do things differently 
Like I didn't even do anything 
Then why you removed me 
Did you think that it will make me feel bad
2/6/25, 9:27 AM - Aishwarya: And your whatsapp pfp , it also made me feel like if me being the person i'm is a reason ,like creating problems for people 🥲
2/6/25, 9:27 AM - Aishwarya: Like if I was different person these things would not have happened in the first place 🥲
2/6/25, 9:27 AM - Aishwarya: And it's also just no guys here have been so nice to me even
2/6/25, 9:28 AM - Aishwarya: Like it's not your fault 
I had told all this back then also though 
I was not blaming you
2/6/25, 9:31 AM - Aishwarya: Like actually everything is alright now 
I have mostly moved on 
Don't worry about it 
Its cool 
And also please don't feel like you did anything wrong
2/6/25, 9:32 AM - Aishwarya: And in fact liking you has helped me fully move on from my previous crush 
That hurt was more 
Like I had already moved on from him 
I explained all that on instagram 
And I think I overshared a bit
2/6/25, 9:35 AM - Aishwarya: Yk I used to listen to your voice note while I fall sleep back then in october ( just for a few days though , coz i got bored,it was just one voice note that was available), to get more feelings
2/6/25, 9:37 AM - Aishwarya: But I was never thinking to say that I liked you and all , to you 
I had even noted down to never do that 
And I had written down many reasons also ,for some reality checks
2/6/25, 9:37 AM - Aishwarya: So like what I wanted to say is , it's not your fault okay 
Just in case , you feel anything like that
2/6/25, 9:38 AM - Aishwarya: Maybe a bit of it is your fault,  but like if you feel bad , like it was not intentional
Like sometimes things happen 
And it's noones fault
2/6/25, 9:40 AM - Aishwarya: In fact I feel better now 
Than when I used to like that guy ( like I had already moved on from him also, back then even ,but hadn't fully moved on I think )
2/6/25, 9:41 AM - Aishwarya: Its just that I have to focus my time and attention on studies etc right now 
I have bit emotional dysregulation problems 
I wish I was not sensitive like that
2/6/25, 9:42 AM - Aishwarya: So like that's the reason 
Not because I don't consider you a good friend 
Or anything like that
2/6/25, 9:42 AM - Aishwarya: I'm think I'm bit late 
Have to get ready 
Bye
2/6/25, 10:22 AM - Aishwarya: <Media omitted>
2/6/25, 10:24 AM - Aishwarya: I didn't see you as a brother and all 
But I had written it down for some reality checks
2/6/25, 10:24 AM - Aishwarya: <Media omitted>
2/6/25, 10:25 AM - Aishwarya: Like these are my diary entries 
Like journaling sort of thing 
I just write down stuff here
2/6/25, 10:36 AM - Aishwarya: <Media omitted>
2/6/25, 10:36 AM - Aishwarya: Like ,not so much
2/6/25, 10:38 AM - Aishwarya: But like I was reminding myself that it's okay to like you ( back then )
Like you are too much younger than me right 
Like not my fault
2/6/25, 10:39 AM - Aishwarya: Its just many other guys suck 
Like what can I do 😓😂
2/6/25, 10:39 AM - Aishwarya: Like just my diary entries
2/6/25, 10:39 AM - Aishwarya: <Media omitted>
2/6/25, 10:46 AM - Aishwarya: This diary entry was after you rejected me 
Like to remind myself that ,it's okay to have liked you 
Like I have gotten rejected by guys my age , same skin tone or darker etc etc 
And the incidents during my college times 
How some guys treated me in general ( was kinda bad )
This incident was nothing compared to all that , in fact it's valid coz you are too much younger
2/6/25, 10:53 AM - Aishwarya: <Media omitted>
2/6/25, 10:55 AM - Aishwarya: See
2/6/25, 10:56 AM - Aishwarya: I see you as a good person only
There is not really any bad vibes 
Just that I can't be friends as of now , coz I think I haven't moved on fully 
Like I have moved on ,but not fully
2/6/25, 10:57 AM - Aishwarya: And coz of this
2/6/25, 4:09 PM - Sayanth: Not everything is about
2/6/25, 4:09 PM - Sayanth: You
2/6/25, 4:09 PM - Sayanth: And i don't have the energy to argue or prove my point or whatever
2/6/25, 4:10 PM - Sayanth: I didn't share that reel it's just I had a collaborative save on insta with u
2/6/25, 4:10 PM - Sayanth: And I accidentally clicked on it that's all
2/6/25, 4:10 PM - Sayanth: I'm not gonna text you or share anything
2/6/25, 4:11 PM - Sayanth: Did u even think of the possibility that I might be going through something
2/6/25, 4:12 PM - Sayanth: Don't text back
2/6/25, 4:14 PM - Sayanth: If that's what u think fine, u can , I'm in no position to argue or give u reassurance
2/6/25, 5:28 PM - Aishwarya: I said that after you blocked me ( or removed me)😭
2/6/25, 5:30 PM - Aishwarya: Before that I was saying sorry 
( about something I said in January)
That time I was hurt 
But it's not an excuse 
But even then, I was not blaming you 
I had explained it back then itself
2/6/25, 5:30 PM - Aishwarya: I'm sorry 
I didn't understand it at first 
I truly didn't know how the feature works
2/6/25, 5:31 PM - Aishwarya: 😭 how can you leave me like that 
You had told about that pinterest girl that she had messaged your followers and all right 😕

What did I do ?🥺😢😔
2/6/25, 5:32 PM - Aishwarya: This so hurtful 
Like what did I even do 😔😢
I feel like you are annoyed at me
2/6/25, 5:32 PM - Aishwarya: Okay compared to what she did , did I do anything ?😕
2/6/25, 5:34 PM - Aishwarya: Okay 
But I didn't say anything 
I was literally saying sorry to you 

And then at that time ,I noticed that you had removed me 

That's when I asked ,if that was the reason why you removed me
2/6/25, 5:37 PM - Aishwarya: <Media omitted>
2/6/25, 5:37 PM - Aishwarya: <Media omitted>
2/6/25, 5:39 PM - Aishwarya: Like I was saying some guys don't care, even when they are in the wrong 
But you are not like that, is what I was saying
2/6/25, 5:41 PM - Aishwarya: <Media omitted>
2/6/25, 5:42 PM - Aishwarya: Me saying sorry and this was the only message I had send , before you had removed me
2/6/25, 5:43 PM - Aishwarya: So like just me saying , don't text me( in a nice way I was saying,  i had told the reason that I didn't move on fully )
2/6/25, 5:43 PM - Aishwarya: So coz of that , you removed me
2/6/25, 5:46 PM - Aishwarya: Like i didn't know about the collaborative save on insta feature 
So I thought you had send that message ( maybe accidentally even,  I haven't accidentally send anyone message coz I always check if I send something accidentally while forwarding , coz I'm bit paranoid about that)

So usually people don't do that , so it is possible that they accidentally send the message
2/6/25, 5:47 PM - Aishwarya: And I didn't know about the collaborative save feature 
So it's that 
Now I understood
2/6/25, 5:48 PM - Aishwarya: I was just reminding you not to text me ( just in case you send me the message accidentally)
2/6/25, 5:48 PM - Aishwarya: At first I was not sure , which is why I had asked, is this a message,  coz it's showing like that 
Coz I didn't understand at first
2/6/25, 5:51 PM - Aishwarya: If you care about me even a little bit 
And if you consider me a friend or even considered me a friend , you will reply to this 

Maybe not today , coz maybe you are going through something else today
2/6/25, 5:51 PM - Aishwarya: I'm so hurt by this and I'm crying
2/6/25, 5:52 PM - Aishwarya: And it's okay ,I don't want to follow you on insta 
You can remove me from your second instagram account as well
2/6/25, 5:53 PM - Aishwarya: But can you reply something 
I feel like I'm someone who creates problems 
And I think I didn't even do anything 
Lot of people create troubles and they are forgiven 😢😔
2/6/25, 5:54 PM - Aishwarya: You told that you forgave this girl 8 times
2/6/25, 5:57 PM - Aishwarya: And you said this about your crush 
But that is different probably 
So I understand 
And maybe it's coz she is beautiful and young 
And has good personality and all 
Good for her
2/6/25, 5:58 PM - Aishwarya: But if I knew that you are someone who is careless about some friend who actually apologizes 
And tries they maximum to not do anything to annoy you 
( but sometimes some things happen,  in my case ,it was a few things that I said in January, but I had already apologized )
2/6/25, 5:59 PM - Aishwarya: Why is there is a discrimination? 🙂
They did may more wrong 
I apologized also 


I'm not filling in the gaps
Coz it is what it is
2/6/25, 6:00 PM - Aishwarya: But like, if I knew that you  are discriminate like this, I would not have become friends with you
2/6/25, 6:01 PM - Aishwarya: Or maybe I understand it wrongly,  coz it always happens with me coz I overthink stuff 

But it is a possibility though
2/6/25, 6:02 PM - Aishwarya: Anyways I told that I'm very hurt over this 
I just want you say if you are annoyed at me or not 

If you can't do that , then you don't care about me 
You probably never cared even 
And then there is my answer
2/6/25, 6:03 PM - Aishwarya: And maybe I did something wrong 
But it's probably not anything major 
Coz I can't even understand why you removed me suddenly 
( maybe you didn't like me saying not to text me again yesterday)
2/6/25, 6:04 PM - Aishwarya: Like I just said not to text me ,in a nice way 

Like I had to say it though 
Coz I didn't understand at first that you did it accidentally
2/6/25, 6:07 PM - Aishwarya: Except that, I didn't say anything 
And then next thing I see , you removed me
2/6/25, 6:08 PM - Aishwarya: Would you have done this if it was those girls ? No 
But like i said, it is what it is
2/6/25, 6:08 PM - Aishwarya: Coz I didn't even do anything,  and see the difference in the way you reacted with me , and those two girls
2/6/25, 6:11 PM - Sayanth: Yes I'd have
2/6/25, 6:12 PM - Aishwarya: Okay
2/6/25, 6:12 PM - Sayanth: See I don't have the energy for this
2/6/25, 6:12 PM - Sayanth: I'm sorry
2/6/25, 6:12 PM - Sayanth: But I really can't rn
2/6/25, 6:12 PM - Aishwarya: Anyways otherwise also it is okay 
Is what I was trying to say
Coz not everything in life is fair 
It is what it is 

Also not your fault 
Not anyone's fault
2/6/25, 6:13 PM - Aishwarya: I just want to know if you are annoyed at me
2/6/25, 6:13 PM - Aishwarya: Or like maybe I did some wrong
2/6/25, 6:13 PM - Aishwarya: ( which I'm not sure )
2/6/25, 6:13 PM - Aishwarya: But I did do some wrong
2/6/25, 6:13 PM - Aishwarya: Like what I said in January
2/6/25, 6:13 PM - Aishwarya: So I said sorry
2/6/25, 6:14 PM - Sayanth: And what hurts me the most is that you doubted me , you literally said that I never cared for you
2/6/25, 6:14 PM - Sayanth: Yes I am
2/6/25, 6:14 PM - Aishwarya: Oh 
Okay so you do care then 🥹
2/6/25, 6:14 PM - Sayanth: Did you think how much all. This would have hurt me
2/6/25, 6:15 PM - Aishwarya: I'm sorry 
I have some trust issues in people 

But you are one of the( few) persons I trust the most though
2/6/25, 6:16 PM - Aishwarya: Coz of my past experiences with people 

I know everyone has been through 

But some people get more trust issues
2/6/25, 6:18 PM - Aishwarya: Like I just said the possibilities, so that you can reflect on it 
Like just in case

You had told before right , you want people to be real with you 
And not lie if something is bothering them 
Only then you can correct itself ( or consider it)

Otherwise how will you know 

You had told so
2/6/25, 6:19 PM - Aishwarya: But I'm sorry for being dramatic 
Like I was just saying it as a possibility 
I know you are not like that 

Like I said,  you are one of the ( few) persons that I trust the most 
Or like lot more
2/6/25, 6:23 PM - Aishwarya: Okay now I feel alright 

I think you just got annoyed ( by what all I said , even though I was just saying it as rare possibility about how people are , not about you ) ; especially coz you probably were already having a stressful day
2/6/25, 6:23 PM - Aishwarya: But you do care about me🥹 , so it's okay 

Good to know 🥹
2/6/25, 6:29 PM - Aishwarya: One more thing I wanted to say 
I send request on instagram
But its not sending 
Can you unblock me on instagram please please ?  

But otherwise also it's okay 
I was just asking
2/6/25, 6:34 PM - Aishwarya: Like the reason you blocked me and all 
Doesn't matter 
You probably was already having a stressful day 

I sorry for annoying
Won't repeat this again 
Just can you unblock me on insta please
2/6/25, 6:34 PM - Aishwarya: Coz it's still not sending 
I tried many times 🥺
2/6/25, 6:34 PM - Aishwarya: The pinterest girl follows you too 
So I too wanna follow
2/6/25, 6:35 PM - Aishwarya: Like not coz of that
2/6/25, 6:35 PM - Aishwarya: I just want to follow you on insta 
That's all 😅
2/6/25, 6:37 PM - Aishwarya: But at the same time ,I respect your choice 
Like just in case ,if you don't want me to follow you on insta 
That's okay🙂
2/6/25, 6:37 PM - Aishwarya: But from what you said , you totally don't mind me following you on insta
2/6/25, 6:39 PM - Aishwarya: So I'm asking again 
Can you please unblock me 
If you haven't read this message by now , or if you are not free now 
You can open instagram and unblock me later on 
But please consider it
2/6/25, 6:42 PM - Aishwarya: It is a request 
But it's your wish 😊
2/6/25, 6:46 PM - Aishwarya: When I create an actual instagram account with followers and all , you can follow me too 😊
2/6/25, 7:00 PM - Aishwarya: Are you worried that such a thing ( like the collaborative save thing or even accidentally sending a reel to me also) might happen again 

And then your time wasted again ( coz I send too many messages and disturbed you )
2/6/25, 7:00 PM - Aishwarya: Once someone is blocked ,such a mistake won't happen for sure 
Probably why you blocked me
2/6/25, 7:00 PM - Aishwarya: Now I understand
2/6/25, 7:03 PM - Aishwarya: Like I promise I won't send many messages, if something like that accidentally happens again 

Coz now I understand that it can happen accidentally also
2/6/25, 7:04 PM - Aishwarya: Yesterday what happened was ,I was not sure what happened 

Like what if you actually did send a reel 
And it was not an accident 
So like that is a possibility as well right 

So in that case , I didn't want to leave you on read or anything 
Coz you are important to me 

So that's why I just said what I wanted for myself
Which is not to send any reel <This message was edited>
2/6/25, 7:06 PM - Aishwarya: So next time ,I know right,  the reel was accidentally send 
( if such a thing ever happens again ,that is ; but it most probably won't happen again yk )


So just in the rare possibility that something like that happens again,  I will just ignore it
2/6/25, 7:07 PM - Aishwarya: I have joined a lot of channels on instagram 
Even though I don't even follow many pages
2/6/25, 7:08 PM - Aishwarya: So all those channels messages are in the chat 
So once if I accidentally send someone a reel ,I would not even know , unless they respond 

So I always recheck the chat , especially if it's some sus reel 😭
( like if I accidentally send it to anyone )
2/6/25, 7:10 PM - Aishwarya: So like I totally know that such things can happen accidentally 
It just hasn't happened to me , coz I always recheck stuff
2/6/25, 7:14 PM - Aishwarya: When I had an original insta during college time,  I used to check if some pic from my gallery got posted on my instagram stories accidentally 😭
Every time I close the instagram app ,I used to check it 💀
Should have two phones , so that then gallery etc is safe
2/6/25, 7:15 PM - Aishwarya: So like I totally understand
2/6/25, 7:16 PM - Aishwarya: Next time something like yesterday happens ( just in case ,like a very rare possibility) , I will ignore it okay
2/6/25, 7:16 PM - Aishwarya: Yesterday I was not sure how to respond yk
2/6/25, 7:18 PM - Aishwarya: Like if I was supposed to ignore it or not ,I got confused 
So I chose the better solution,  and I thought it was to reply something 😅
( the other option is to ignore right )
Coz I didn't know for sure if it was accidental 


Like what if it was not accidental 
So that's how I thought yesterday
2/6/25, 7:18 PM - Aishwarya: You understand now right ?
2/6/25, 7:20 PM - Aishwarya: I think I said it in a clear way 
And in my case ,I didn't know such a feature existed ( that also a reason I got confused , if to reply or not , or just ignore it  )

Like I have seen such a feature, but I don't know any details
2/6/25, 7:21 PM - Aishwarya: So I promise that such a thing won't happen again in the future 

I will ignore the reel ( on the rare possibility something like that happen again accidentally )

And I promise I surely won't create a scene 😭
2/6/25, 7:22 PM - Aishwarya: So can you please unblock me on instagram?
2/6/25, 7:30 PM - Aishwarya: Oh ,I just paid attention to this now
2/6/25, 7:31 PM - Aishwarya: I just got lost in this 😭

Like this means you do care right
2/6/25, 7:32 PM - Aishwarya: So I think I will ask after a few days to unblock me on instagram 
Maybe then you won't be annoyed anymore
2/6/25, 7:42 PM - Sayanth: You can blame me all you want or think of me as u wish , I don't care , I've never ever hurt never even thought about it , but guess what you still don't trust me, I had asked you to stay when u said u wanted to stop contact
2/6/25, 7:44 PM - Aishwarya: I think of you as a good person 
That is why I message so much even 
( in the sense ,my automatic instinct is resolve any perceived conflict, but I just end up creating more problems 😓)
2/6/25, 7:46 PM - Aishwarya: But yes some small doubt is there 
But that I don't trust anybody except me though
2/6/25, 7:49 PM - Aishwarya: Stop contact in the sense , till I have fully moved on 

Plus its just I don't have energy to talk to anyone in general, as of now though
2/6/25, 7:51 PM - Aishwarya: Plus there are many followers in your insta , who you are not in contact with right 

Why can't I also be in that
2/6/25, 7:53 PM - Aishwarya: I think you have noone in your blocked list probably 
Or maybe someone who you had major fight with
2/6/25, 7:56 PM - Aishwarya: Even your crush,  she blocked you right 
You don't prefer being blocked by her 
But it's just something she wanted ( like it's her account right )
And I don't think there was a fight 
Atleast nothing major 

Just said this to say that you haven't blocked anyone
2/6/25, 7:56 PM - Aishwarya: I think girls are so caring
2/6/25, 7:57 PM - Aishwarya: I remember you sharing some chat screenshot 
She wanted you to move on coz she was not interested in you ( idk why though,you have so many qualities )
2/6/25, 7:58 PM - Aishwarya: So she was like don't text her 
Plus also she didn't want to be disturbed also 

Like she wanted good for you and her also
2/6/25, 7:58 PM - Aishwarya: Its just so many guys are bit selfish 
So guys who are mostly good are special
2/6/25, 7:59 PM - Aishwarya: Nothing wrong with that 
I have character flaws too 
So I'm not saying in judging kind of way
2/6/25, 8:01 PM - Aishwarya: Idk maybe your crush was not so good to you 
But from the chat screenshot it seemed like she cared 
And one girl who was your second crush,  she seemed even more good
2/6/25, 8:03 PM - Aishwarya: But in my case ,all my crushes I would categorize them as lowkey toxic atleast ( except a rare few of them )
Like so many guys actually, not just crushes
2/6/25, 8:03 PM - Aishwarya: But you are not like that 
So ofcourse you are special to me
2/6/25, 8:04 PM - Aishwarya: Like I don't have much male figures to see men in good light
2/6/25, 8:05 PM - Aishwarya: I don't even like my brother that much 😭
I think he is lowkey better than many other guys , from here
2/6/25, 8:06 PM - Aishwarya: Just being reminded that good men exist , like I don't know how to explain it
2/6/25, 8:06 PM - Aishwarya: And like you are good even at this age also 
But like the guys in my college were not 
So like they did have a character flaw
2/6/25, 8:07 PM - Aishwarya: Idk all those things are bit healing 🙂
2/6/25, 8:08 PM - Aishwarya: I mean like some of them didn't even bother to put on a fake good persona
2/6/25, 8:09 PM - Aishwarya: Like outside of college, guys have been the same too 
Especially here 
But the guys from liberal countries are kinda good on average 
Atleast not intolerable
2/6/25, 8:10 PM - Aishwarya: You are literally the only guy from india , who I don't think of that way about 
( for the most part atleast,  but those are some minor doubts )
2/6/25, 8:12 PM - Aishwarya: Like not saying there aren't other good guys 
Just I have been disappointed in some way in them 
And like I could not even think of it in a, maybe he is not like that , kind of way
2/6/25, 8:12 PM - Aishwarya: Actually maybe two more guys from india
2/6/25, 8:12 PM - Aishwarya: But you are more good comparatively
2/6/25, 8:16 PM - Aishwarya: But they are not my friends 
Was bit acquaintances for some time 
And also not in contact anymore
2/6/25, 8:17 PM - Aishwarya: And one guy actually told me ,not to text him again 

It was because one day I messaged him and he didn't reply
( like he had told me previously a week ago ,that I can text him when I want , he will reply when he free , he would be free mostly ,especially at certain times)
2/6/25, 8:18 PM - Aishwarya: So like I called him 
Coz he was not replying 

I didn't think it would annoy him that much 
It did
2/6/25, 8:19 PM - Aishwarya: And he told not to text him again 🙂
And like he has his own problems etc 
He is stressed himself
2/6/25, 8:20 PM - Aishwarya: But I have heard of people saying that they have friends who are there for them 
Like available kind of friends
2/6/25, 8:20 PM - Aishwarya: So I thought maybe I also found such friends and he is such a friend 
Like he had told I can text
2/6/25, 8:21 PM - Aishwarya: But he never said to call 
If that is okay 
I think he probably was with his friends 
There was some noise in  background
2/6/25, 8:22 PM - Aishwarya: Anyways, after he told not to text 
I never disturbed him again 
And felt bad about it 
So I kept that mind always 
With my other friends 
Not to annoy them
2/6/25, 8:23 PM - Aishwarya: And also if I feel like I annoyed them ,I lose interest anyways 
I don't feel like I'm bothering someone 
Except if they are special persons 
( they are probably not ,it's probably that many other people sucks )
2/6/25, 8:24 PM - Aishwarya: Only in such a case ,I have disturbed them again 
But also , they never said I'm annoying 
With you , it was like that
2/6/25, 8:26 PM - Aishwarya: I think only you 
All others if i feel they find me annoying , or if I find them annoying 
I never talk to them again 
I just reply if they ever text 
But that also only rarely happens <This message was edited>
2/6/25, 8:27 PM - Aishwarya: So like that is why 
You are special to me
2/6/25, 8:28 PM - Aishwarya: I think maybe you are not able to understand it fully
2/6/25, 8:28 PM - Aishwarya: Coz girls are good yk
2/6/25, 8:28 PM - Aishwarya: Like they are tolerable atleast
2/6/25, 8:28 PM - Aishwarya: Atleast they fake being good
2/6/25, 8:31 PM - Aishwarya: For example ,there was one guy who I was acquaintances with 
I told him that I had watched some movie that day 
He told that he watched that movie coz the actress is hot and it has nsfw scenes
2/6/25, 8:32 PM - Aishwarya: He is cute and fair 
So like it's more okay for him to be like that 
Like if he was atleast not fair , I would not even have maintained an acquaintance level friendship with him ( like it's just a boundary that I have )
2/6/25, 8:33 PM - Aishwarya: If the world was so not oversexualized ,my life and my college life would have been different
2/6/25, 8:34 PM - Aishwarya: So if the guy is atleast fair and okay looking, then that means he won't be creating another me 
So it's not that triggering 

But I would consider such guys good friend material in general 
Like not much
2/6/25, 8:37 PM - Aishwarya: I think guys who are not so horny ( or atleast don't make it their whole personality, like them being naturally like that, or due to discipline)  , they tend to make more good friends than female friends 

Only thing is that opposite gender friendships is bit complicated 
If one of them is insecure especially
2/6/25, 8:39 PM - Aishwarya: And they forgive more easily also 
For small things that is
2/6/25, 8:41 PM - Aishwarya: Like in india ,I know many girls have many guy friends and all 
But like that is different
2/6/25, 8:43 PM - Aishwarya: It's like if the girl is getting validation from the guy ,she overlooks him having some typical male behaviors
2/6/25, 8:44 PM - Aishwarya: Like I told about an altruistic guy right, like that guy is someone who seeks validation from multiple girls ( like three girls or so in his case )
2/6/25, 8:45 PM - Aishwarya: After getting to know him , have put more boundaries for myself
2/6/25, 8:45 PM - Aishwarya: In the sense ,in making guy friends who are from india
2/6/25, 8:45 PM - Aishwarya: In future also
2/6/25, 8:47 PM - Aishwarya: Which is kind of made me realize, how much I don't have a dating future in india
2/6/25, 8:47 PM - Aishwarya: Its like I don't like them to begin with 
Atleast most of them
2/6/25, 8:48 PM - Aishwarya: Outside India atleast I can try to find if someone likes me back 
Or can atleast make good friends
2/6/25, 8:48 PM - Aishwarya: Like it triggered some trauma for a moment
2/6/25, 8:49 PM - Aishwarya: I felt like he is doing too much( like even the altruism thing ) just to find a girl to date
2/6/25, 8:50 PM - Aishwarya: And also what he prefers is not even a serious relationship 
He can't find anything casual 
Hookups or even fwb
So he prefers to date 
That's what I understood
2/6/25, 8:52 PM - Aishwarya: And he once told me that he don't like coconaad subreddit 
Coz some people are flexing their hookups there 
And I told that I didn't feel so , and told that people do vent about relationships etc ,that's all
2/6/25, 8:52 PM - Aishwarya: Like he don't mind relationships being discussed
2/6/25, 8:53 PM - Aishwarya: He told he gets jealous when he sees stories there about hookups 
( but I haven't noticed those )
2/6/25, 8:54 PM - Aishwarya: That was the first red flag 
Red flag in the sense, that person is not a tolerable person to be around
2/6/25, 8:55 PM - Aishwarya: Then he shared some post from twoxindia
2/6/25, 8:56 PM - Aishwarya: It was a post about a girl saying she is uncomfortable of men roaming around shirtless 
Especially uncles 
I personally have never felt uncomfortable ( except if I have already read the person as creepy)
2/6/25, 8:57 PM - Aishwarya: He just shared it randomly while talking about reddit in some conversation
2/6/25, 8:57 PM - Aishwarya: Like that's just unnecessarily hating on girls
2/6/25, 8:57 PM - Aishwarya: But at the same time he has few female friends 
Two girls especially
2/6/25, 8:59 PM - Aishwarya: I had asked him if he ever had crush on them 
Then as expected he did 
Like such guys can only be nice to girls they are trying to date
2/6/25, 9:00 PM - Aishwarya: Like nothing wrong with that 
Its just that guys who don't like female gender seeking out relationships or any thing related 
Just makes me feel some type of way
2/6/25, 9:02 PM - Aishwarya: But when fair guys who are okay looking atleast 
Especially white guys,  if they do it 
I don't mind much 
😭
2/6/25, 9:02 PM - Aishwarya: Its like they creating the somewhat beauty standards girlies 
So it's not triggering
2/6/25, 9:02 PM - Aishwarya: That's why
2/6/25, 9:03 PM - Aishwarya: And like such girls overcomes traumas like it's nothing
2/6/25, 9:04 PM - Aishwarya: My best friend in college , she got her lip lock clips leaked 
But I think that's not much trauma 
She has good self confidence, she is not much effected by others opinions
2/6/25, 9:07 PM - Aishwarya: She got cheated by her ex in one of the worst way ( he cheated on her with a classmate also )
Plus he created an insta account and he was literally following many slut like real accounts and only fans lite account , from his main account 
No other guy in my class account was that 
They probably have a finsta for that
2/6/25, 9:07 PM - Aishwarya: Oh I don't know if you will read all this
2/6/25, 9:08 PM - Aishwarya: Like this is another reason I want you to understand , that different girls are different
2/6/25, 9:09 PM - Aishwarya: Like girls with self confidence are built different 
It could be from they either being pretty,  or falsely thinking they are pretty
2/6/25, 9:10 PM - Aishwarya: So if the pinterest girl is still friends with you , it's coz of that 
Or maybe her crush has fully faded
2/6/25, 9:10 PM - Aishwarya: Plus I have a feeling that she is not that pretty
2/6/25, 9:11 PM - Aishwarya: Anyways
2/6/25, 9:11 PM - Aishwarya: But she is confident
2/6/25, 9:12 PM - Aishwarya: Ohh
2/6/25, 9:12 PM - Aishwarya: Or like she is talking to multiple guys 
Maybe there is some guy she likes now ,more than you
2/6/25, 9:13 PM - Aishwarya: Or even otherwise also
2/6/25, 9:14 PM - Aishwarya: So like she is not attached to you at all 
Not even remotely 
Plus probably more emotionally regulated person yk
2/6/25, 9:17 PM - Aishwarya: Also imagine if some girl is dating a guy 
But that guy has many side chicks 
So she wants that too 
And you are that guy for her 
( like even if you are not interested in her at all )
( one reason is you can do better , so like you are not her bf or anything  )
2/6/25, 9:18 PM - Aishwarya: Plus you are cute right
2/6/25, 9:19 PM - Aishwarya: And you yourself said that on dating apps and all  , both genders go for lighter skin peoples 
Girls also do that
2/6/25, 9:19 PM - Aishwarya: And she is young , so she must be talking to many guys
2/6/25, 9:20 PM - Aishwarya: Oh and she is in college 
She must be having some one sided crush or crushes atleast 
Plus guy friends
2/6/25, 9:20 PM - Aishwarya: In my case no one 🙂 mostly
2/6/25, 9:20 PM - Aishwarya: So there is a difference
2/6/25, 9:21 PM - Aishwarya: So like that's why I said that I can't stay in contact
2/6/25, 9:21 PM - Aishwarya: But I can though
2/6/25, 9:22 PM - Aishwarya: Like maybe
2/6/25, 9:22 PM - Aishwarya: But I won't be sending any reels or anything 
Or text you 
So that is not possible
2/6/25, 9:22 PM - Aishwarya: And then you won't also right
2/6/25, 9:23 PM - Aishwarya: Like I don't know how to say
2/6/25, 9:24 PM - Aishwarya: So like it's not possible
2/6/25, 9:24 PM - Aishwarya: Like I'm the one sending reels always 
And I don't watch much reels these days to begin with
2/6/25, 9:25 PM - Aishwarya: Anyways
2/6/25, 9:25 PM - Aishwarya: The pinterest girl for example
2/6/25, 9:25 PM - Aishwarya: Those are the reasons she is still actively still in contact with you
2/6/25, 9:26 PM - Aishwarya: Like ofcourse she is a good friend also
2/6/25, 9:26 PM - Aishwarya: But I'm also a good friend
2/6/25, 9:35 PM - Aishwarya: Like not trusting etc is not the reason 

I haven't fully moved on 

So i would get bit jealous of girls you like 😅

I have already told 

Plus due to studies me not having time to be jealous 
That's why I didn't text you for a long while
2/6/25, 9:36 PM - Aishwarya: But pinterest girl for example is different 
Coz she is talking to many guys 
Plus I don't think she has that much pressure for studies 

Plus probably she is more emotionally regulated 
So there is difference
2/6/25, 9:45 PM - Aishwarya: And like I'm not even talking with anyone 
Friend or anyone 
Like literally
2/6/25, 9:47 PM - Aishwarya: I have one friend , he told I can text him 
And he will reply when he sees the message 
I don't even text him except once a week at max 
Coz I can't just text him just when i'm in need or something
2/6/25, 9:49 PM - Aishwarya: He is a white guy 
Its like also motivating me even more to work towards my going abroad dreams
2/6/25, 9:51 PM - Aishwarya: Guys here makes me so unmotivated for life
2/6/25, 9:56 PM - Aishwarya: You are like one of few things about india that I like
2/6/25, 9:57 PM - Aishwarya: And like a good male figure
2/6/25, 10:00 PM - Aishwarya: There are few white guys that I have liked company of ,as much as you 
And even the guys who I just once talked with they have so much potential 
I could literally feel they are much better than guys here 
( other ethnicities guys too )
And the white guys who date black girls also( the ones I don't know personally also ) they are so special to me 
Lot more than you
2/6/25, 10:02 PM - Aishwarya: Like one black guy acquaintance, who is from US , I like him so much more as person 
Than almost most guys I have known from here 


Even the most annoying black guy from US etc  was less annoying than average annoying guy here
2/6/25, 10:04 PM - Aishwarya: Like most of them ,in the few of them who I have maintained contact with 
They all text me ,even when I don't text
2/6/25, 10:04 PM - Aishwarya: Like I don't text for a long while,  but then they text me
2/6/25, 10:06 PM - Aishwarya: The only guys from here who did that, it was due to some other reason
2/6/25, 10:07 PM - Aishwarya: Like these people do that , coz either they find me interesting coz I'm from different country 
Plus they kind of bit find me pretty 
Or mix of both 

Some is friendly dynamic 
Some is bit flirty dynamic 

It either makes me feel happy or feminine or both
2/6/25, 10:08 PM - Aishwarya: Its either coz they know that I like them 
So like to seek that validation
2/6/25, 10:08 PM - Aishwarya: I told about one guy long ago
2/6/25, 10:09 PM - Aishwarya: He texted me after a long while 
I called him bro
2/6/25, 10:09 PM - Aishwarya: Like he definitely was not interested in what I was saying 
And found me annoying 
He literally had judged me even
2/6/25, 10:13 PM - Aishwarya: And then one guy friend who texted me after I stopped texting him ( because he insulted my skin colour girls )

I haven't picked up his call because I feel he will say some colorist stuff in call also 
Otherwise also I wouldn't pick up call
2/6/25, 10:14 PM - Aishwarya: Coz I don't want to see him ever again 
Or talk to him ever again 
He's a bully 
But that's a rare case probably 
But I didn't expect this much
2/6/25, 10:15 PM - Aishwarya: I don't know you are like so much better than all guys I have met from india 
In fact so good
2/6/25, 10:15 PM - Aishwarya: Its like something rare for me
2/6/25, 10:16 PM - Aishwarya: But unfortunately due me having not fully moved on from you ( like in a having crush kind of way )
2/6/25, 10:16 PM - Aishwarya: Like I don't think I have crush on you anymore
2/6/25, 10:16 PM - Aishwarya: But at the same time ,I would be jealous atleast little bit
2/6/25, 10:16 PM - Aishwarya: Of girls you like yk
2/6/25, 10:17 PM - Aishwarya: So that means only after getting new crush, I would have fully moved on from you I think
2/6/25, 10:18 PM - Aishwarya: Plus the studies
So I don't have time to feel negative emotions 
Coz I get sucked into it
2/6/25, 10:21 PM - Aishwarya: Like I can only study well in peace 
I think its like that for everyone 
But some people have more emotional regulation and resilience
2/6/25, 10:21 PM - Aishwarya: So that's why I told like that
2/6/25, 10:23 PM - Aishwarya: Like I don't want to be actively friends with you
2/6/25, 10:23 PM - Aishwarya: But sometimes when I get reminded of you 
Its like bit positivity 
Idk how to say 
Coz like you have been so nice to me
2/6/25, 10:24 PM - Aishwarya: But I don't want that crush part of thing to be there, like it's gone 
But not fully gone
2/6/25, 10:24 PM - Aishwarya: So I think if I'm actually close with you again , I might get jealous of girls you like etc
2/6/25, 10:27 PM - Aishwarya: And if I stay in contact with you , I think like that part is more 
Like it gets built again 
Maybe 
Or atleast might feel jealous 
I just don't like uncomfortable feelings especially since I have studies going on
2/6/25, 10:28 PM - Aishwarya: Like not staying friends is a choice right , like doesn't mean either side is not on good terms 

Its different than you being annoyed at me etc
2/6/25, 10:29 PM - Aishwarya: Like you being just so nice to me was bit healing 
Especially related to some incidents that happened in college 
Like it's in the past 
But still
2/6/25, 10:30 PM - Aishwarya: Not just related to crushes
2/6/25, 10:30 PM - Aishwarya: Like in general
2/6/25, 10:30 PM - Aishwarya: Mainly guys
2/6/25, 10:33 PM - Aishwarya: I know that you blocked me coz of you not wanting to accidental send any reel etc on instagram again 
Like yesterday
2/6/25, 10:33 PM - Aishwarya: But I explained about that right
2/6/25, 10:34 PM - Aishwarya: But you blocking me totally,  it feels like you are not there in my life at all 
Like it probably doesn't make much sense
2/6/25, 10:36 PM - Aishwarya: Like not being blocked and all 
But not in contact also
2/6/25, 10:36 PM - Aishwarya: That is possible right ?😭
2/6/25, 10:36 PM - Aishwarya: Its simple
2/6/25, 10:38 PM - Aishwarya: And I think that if i don't even see you on instagram 
I will forget about you 

Plus I don't want to be someone in your block list 
That just feels like there was some problem with you
2/6/25, 10:40 PM - Aishwarya: And if I forget about you ,or like feel like I'm not even in good terms 
I think I will get some past memories of college etc 
Just people ,mostly guys treating me badly etc ( not just related to crushes)
2/6/25, 10:47 PM - Aishwarya: And also the girls you like , it's bit more healthy kind of jealousy
2/6/25, 10:48 PM - Aishwarya: Plus like you actually respects girls right
2/6/25, 10:49 PM - Aishwarya: And you are someone who is capable of actually loving that girl
2/6/25, 10:49 PM - Aishwarya: Comparatively to many other guys I know atleast
2/6/25, 10:50 PM - Aishwarya: Like in a motivating to be better kind of way
2/6/25, 10:52 PM - Aishwarya: Are you able to understand?
2/6/25, 10:52 PM - Aishwarya: Like there is an in between right 
Doesn't have to be blocked and all
2/6/25, 10:53 PM - Aishwarya: And also you don't normally block people
2/6/25, 10:54 PM - Aishwarya: So especially coz of that ,I don't want to be in that list
2/6/25, 10:54 PM - Aishwarya: Like that is not the vibe
2/6/25, 10:55 PM - Aishwarya: Maybe I can also attract such a guy
2/6/25, 10:56 PM - Aishwarya: Like the girls you like
2/6/25, 10:57 PM - Aishwarya: To be that kind of girl
2/6/25, 10:57 PM - Aishwarya: That's more healthy kind of jealousy
2/6/25, 10:58 PM - Aishwarya: Like feeling competitive with girls ,who trash guys like, is not the vibe
2/6/25, 10:59 PM - Aishwarya: Plus like you blocking me means that you have some problem with me 
It might not be like that 
But it will feel like that
2/6/25, 11:00 PM - Aishwarya: And like being blocked is bit unfeminine
2/6/25, 11:01 PM - Aishwarya: Unless it's a situation of the guy not wanting to see the said girls post ( maybe he gets jealous seeing her with other girls)
So him blocking her coz of that 
That is different
2/6/25, 11:03 PM - Aishwarya: I mean you are the opposite of trash guy is what I meant 😭
2/6/25, 11:07 PM - Aishwarya: And if you post something,  I also want to be able to see that
2/6/25, 11:12 PM - Aishwarya: I think otherwise I would totally forget about you
2/6/25, 11:12 PM - Aishwarya: I will get used to it
2/6/25, 11:12 PM - Aishwarya: But that is not the way I prefer
2/6/25, 11:13 PM - Aishwarya: Like an in-between is possible <This message was edited>
2/6/25, 11:13 PM - Aishwarya: It doesn't have to be extreme ends
2/6/25, 11:15 PM - Aishwarya: Just like how it was till day before yesterday
2/6/25, 11:16 PM - Aishwarya: Like can you unblock me ?
2/6/25, 11:16 PM - Aishwarya: It doesn't make any difference for you
2/6/25, 11:17 PM - Aishwarya: If I'm blocked or not
2/6/25, 11:19 PM - Aishwarya: I have like bit object impermanence thing
2/6/25, 11:20 PM - Aishwarya: Probably many people have it
2/6/25, 11:21 PM - Aishwarya: Its like if I have no type of contact with you , I might forget about you
2/6/25, 11:21 PM - Aishwarya: But I will get used to it
2/6/25, 11:21 PM - Aishwarya: But I prefer it being not like that
2/6/25, 11:22 PM - Aishwarya: But at the same time, I don't want to be attached to you also
2/6/25, 11:25 PM - Aishwarya: Like it's a simple thing right
2/6/25, 11:26 PM - Aishwarya: Can you please unblock me on instagram ?
Like it's a simple thing
2/6/25, 11:28 PM - Aishwarya: I'm tired of asking again and again 😕😭
2/6/25, 11:30 PM - Aishwarya: Also there is some small doubt I have about you 
But I can't ask you
2/6/25, 11:31 PM - Aishwarya: But doesn't matter really
2/6/25, 11:32 PM - Aishwarya: But also you have been too nice , so like that's not possible
2/6/25, 11:43 PM - Aishwarya: And also you did say you care about me 
And like you are empathetic towards some other people as well
2/6/25, 11:44 PM - Aishwarya: But like why you are not considering my request
2/6/25, 11:49 PM - Aishwarya: Yk like I little bit got jealous of one girl 
But like it's your friend probably
2/6/25, 11:50 PM - Aishwarya: Like different types of feelings in small amounts 
Or like in moderate amounts 
Its sometimes good
2/6/25, 11:50 PM - Aishwarya: Even like jealousy
2/6/25, 11:51 PM - Aishwarya: Like imagine i forgot about you 
Doesn't mean I won't feel jealous of girls
2/6/25, 11:52 PM - Aishwarya: Maybe I will get jealous of some other guy's girls
2/6/25, 11:53 PM - Aishwarya: And then there some other girl 
That I got bit jealous of 
I had liked noted it down in my diary back then
2/6/25, 11:54 PM - Aishwarya: I was like you are talking to that girl ,but like not even replying to my texts
2/6/25, 11:56 PM - Aishwarya: But like if I totally forgot about you , then maybe I like some other guy 
Like I won't
Or like just feeling jealous of random girls 

Like those things happen
2/6/25, 11:56 PM - Aishwarya: This is balanced
2/6/25, 11:57 PM - Aishwarya: Like I'm not sure if you are that good guy 
But you are definitely better than many guys
2/6/25, 11:58 PM - Aishwarya: In the sense, in my mind there is some version of you , but idk if you are that good 
But in reality it doesn't matter though
2/6/25, 11:59 PM - Aishwarya: Also you follow on spotify even,  one new girl 
Who is not your old crush 
But you said something opposite of that
2/6/25, 11:59 PM - Aishwarya: Like I'm not saying about this particular thing
2/7/25, 12:00 AM - Aishwarya: Coz that and all , it's your life
2/7/25, 12:00 AM - Aishwarya: But what I meant is that , if there is one lie , for example , there can be other lies too 
Like the possibility yk
2/7/25, 12:02 AM - Aishwarya: I mean like lies in other areas 
You saying you care about me 
Like I know you don't hate me or dislike me
2/7/25, 12:02 AM - Aishwarya: I just want you to show some basic care 
Especially it's not taking away anything from you
2/7/25, 12:03 AM - Aishwarya: Like for example ,I requested you so many times, if you can unblock me on instagram
2/7/25, 12:03 AM - Aishwarya: You didn't
2/7/25, 12:03 AM - Aishwarya: It is literally not taking away anything from you 
Not your time 
Nothing 
Its just a simple thing
2/7/25, 12:08 AM - Aishwarya: Also like staying in contact thing , it's like just look at the situation 
Coz of some small argument , im the one who is wasting time on this 
You are probably studying, or doing some work related to your college,  or talking to some girl 
Literally being productive 
Or having the time of your life
2/7/25, 12:08 AM - Aishwarya: If you did care you would try to resolve the situation right
2/7/25, 12:14 AM - Aishwarya: Like I also do that sometimes 
Nothing wrong with it 
But like you are forcing me into a situation that I don't want to be in 

Forcing me in the sense,  you know that I care a lot,  coz I don't have much good friends and all 
Unlike you 
So you know that if you say that something annoyed you , I will worry about it
2/7/25, 12:16 AM - Aishwarya: Why are saying about it again 
I told many times right, I can't stay in contact because I haven't fully moved on 

Not related to if I trust you 
Or consider you a good person or not 
I consider you a good person
If not I wouldn't care
2/7/25, 12:18 AM - Aishwarya: See it's not even something you really want to do 

So not even making much difference for you 
Or any difference
2/7/25, 12:22 AM - Aishwarya: I was literally saying that I understand that the reel was send accidentally 
Coz of the collaborative save feature 

Where did I blame you ?
2/7/25, 12:23 AM - Aishwarya: But I didn't know for sure 
So just in case you send the reel ( like how we used to send reels previously) , I didn't want to leave you on read 

So I couldn't ignore your yesterday's message ( the reel )
2/7/25, 12:24 AM - Aishwarya: Are you able to understand ? 😭
You didn't even read clearly ig
2/7/25, 12:25 AM - Aishwarya: Where did I blame you for yesterday ?
2/7/25, 12:25 AM - Aishwarya: Or where did I blame you
2/7/25, 12:26 AM - Aishwarya: Why did you say 'you can blame me all you want '

I was literally not blaming you 

Did you even read my messages
2/7/25, 12:27 AM - Aishwarya: Like you probably read few of my messages passively , and misunderstood me
2/7/25, 12:27 AM - Aishwarya: I was not blaming you for yesterday 
Literally the opposite 

I was trying to say it happened to me also before
2/7/25, 12:29 AM - Aishwarya: Like if you had responded rudely ,I would have been so gone 
Like bye bye
2/7/25, 12:31 AM - Aishwarya: But you are being mean to me , by ignoring me and saying things like ,I'm blaming you 

When I'm literally saying that you are the most good guy I know from india 

And while me trying to explain that I totally understand what happened yesterday 
( I nowhere blamed you )(
2/7/25, 12:33 AM - Aishwarya: Like if I feel like you are not a good person 
Or don't care about me as a friend 
I would totally be gone from your life
2/7/25, 12:35 AM - Aishwarya: But since i think of you as this good person ,I feel guilty if I annoyed you ( what happened yesterday for example )

So I was trying to explain about it 
To resolve the issue
2/7/25, 12:35 AM - Aishwarya: And I said sorry even 
And told I won't repeat this again
2/7/25, 12:39 AM - Aishwarya: And I'm not even sure if you are annoyed 

The only annoyed you feel is , why is this woman sending so many messages,  let me mute this chat 
Like that kind of annoyed 


Like no other emotional reactions 
Unlike me 

Which is why, you don't care to resolve the conflict even 😭
2/7/25, 12:47 AM - Aishwarya: Yea I know 
You have lot more interesting things to do 
Which and all is totally valid 
Its your life 

Like you never send me reels or texts for many weeks , when were friends last year 
( like you used to reply after many days even )
But you were buzy also , so I understand 




But I just thought maybe you did send me the reel because you missed me or something ( like even though it's not respecting boundaries much coz I told not to text )
Like that is a small possibility too right ( like in my mind )
And I didn't want to leave you on read , if that was the case
2/7/25, 12:49 AM - Aishwarya: Remember I didn't reply to a reel you send intentionally 
And then you send another reel 
And also asked if I'm okay 
Coz I always respond to reels you send 
So you probably got bit worried if I don't want to be friends again 

Idk I just felt so
2/7/25, 12:50 AM - Aishwarya: So like I thought yesterday it was like that 
Even though yesterday's is different coz I had told previously not to send any reel 

But it was due to collaborative save 
And it was accidental
2/7/25, 2:03 AM - Aishwarya: I will send you some voice notes to explain it better
I just want the conflict to be resolved 

You unblocking me or not , it's your choice 
But we probably won't talk again

Especially because of any misunderstanding 
Sometimes we can't understand the tone from texts 
I just want any conflict ( if any) to be resolved 

Unblocking or not ,it's your wish 
But it would be good if you can unblock me on instagram
I want to follow you too <This message was edited>
2/7/25, 12:30 PM - Aishwarya: When you are free please do listen to the voice notes okay 

Text messages don't have to read ( long text messages can be confusing ,I think thats why you misunderstood me and got annoyed )
2/7/25, 12:31 PM - Aishwarya: Rest I will send later on, now I'm outside
2/7/25, 12:35 PM - Aishwarya: And you have to say that ,you understood 

And that , you are not annoyed at me ( I literally had tried my best, to not create any conflict ; so it's not fair yk ; it's just that ,you misunderstood me ; what you thought is, not what i had meant) <This message was edited>

Thanks
2/9/25, 11:05 PM - Aishwarya: Hi 😊
2/9/25, 11:06 PM - Aishwarya: I just saw the request few minutes ago 
And then my mom called 
I'm going somewhere tomorrow morning 
So have to go to sleep early
2/9/25, 11:07 PM - Aishwarya: Thanks btw 😊
2/9/25, 11:07 PM - Aishwarya: Like I can follow you right
2/9/25, 11:09 PM - Aishwarya: But then later I thought about it 
And got confused with what I said 
Like I want to follow you 
But won't it be distracting ? I thought about it like that, only after you blocked me and after long while after that , that thought occurred to me <This message was edited>
2/9/25, 11:10 PM - Aishwarya: Can I avail this later on ?😭
2/9/25, 11:12 PM - Aishwarya: I was like confused to follow now or later 

I want to think about it 

But I just replied today itself 
Coz tomorrow I won't be able to reply probably coz I'm not at home 
And I don't want you to think I'm deliberately not replying
2/9/25, 11:14 PM - Aishwarya: Coz of studies btw
2/9/25, 11:21 PM - Aishwarya: My one friend adviced me to block you everywhere 
( coz when I told him that you are cute and all ,and that I used to like you ; and then he asked if I still like you )
And he told then it might be distracting for me 
I was asking for advice on what to do ,especially since studies going on
2/10/25, 12:30 AM - Aishwarya: Don't worry😊 I have mostly fully moved on 
It's just that I haven't liked anyone new 
So it's not fully gone I think 
Idk
2/10/25, 12:32 AM - Aishwarya: In the sense , after I dating some guy or guys 
Or anything close 

Then I can see you as fully a friend , or brother, like a bit
2/10/25, 12:35 AM - Aishwarya: Its just that no guy from india has ever been so nice to me as you have been 
Coz of my skin colour I believe 
Otherwise this would not have happened to me 
( like liking someone so much young )
And I lost the friendship also
2/10/25, 12:40 AM - Aishwarya: Even if you were genuinely nice and actually cared about me ; or didnt , it's probably an in between; doesn't really matter 
Actually many guys didn't even bother to be fake nice to me even 
Or even just bit nice
2/10/25, 12:41 AM - Aishwarya: I hope you understand my situation
2/10/25, 12:42 AM - Aishwarya: And like, coz of studies
2/10/25, 12:44 AM - Aishwarya: And I have to give my maximum focus , time and attention there 
Many hours of my last two days ,I spend it explaining to you ( about the last incident that happened)
2/10/25, 12:44 AM - Aishwarya: And you didn't even give any time , even though the accident was from your side
( like the beginning of it ) <This message was edited>
2/10/25, 12:47 AM - Aishwarya: I'm sure you are a good person,  good friend and caring ( about people you care about )
2/10/25, 12:50 AM - Aishwarya: Even in friendships, the efforts and care should be somewhat balanced atleast 
Otherwise it's not healthy 

But like in this case,  I haven't fully moved on ; so there is that factor also
2/10/25, 12:53 AM - Aishwarya: So coz of things like this  , even after I have fully moved on , I don't know how healthy the friendship is 

But like, once I have fully moved on , I will care less 
Then it will be balanced
So it will be balanced friendship
2/10/25, 12:57 AM - Aishwarya: But in a realistic sense ,we won't be friends in future also, most probably 
Coz like that's in future 

Plus I also would have found more number of, other good friends

Or more good, other friends
2/10/25, 1:00 AM - Aishwarya: Idk if all this explanation was needed 
But I always try to part ways with friends on good terms if possible 
( atleast from my side)

Their side, they usually don't care , or they are on good terms too, or atleast okay terms mostly 

So that's why I explained so much
2/10/25, 2:59 PM - Aishwarya: Hi
2/10/25, 3:00 PM - Aishwarya: I was thinking to block you soon ,coz I already explained the whys 
So I think you already understood 
That it's not that I don't consider you a good friend or good person
2/10/25, 3:01 PM - Aishwarya: I mean like blocking without waiting for more hours 
Coz you might think I'm not blocking soon coz I want attention from your replies or something 
Idk doesn't make much sense 
But people can think like that
2/10/25, 3:02 PM - Aishwarya: Like the possibility
2/10/25, 3:02 PM - Aishwarya: But at the same time ,I wanted to explain a bit more 
But then I thought no need
2/10/25, 3:03 PM - Aishwarya: Then I got reminded of something you told me long ago
2/10/25, 3:05 PM - Aishwarya: <Media omitted>
2/10/25, 3:06 PM - Aishwarya: How you were towards a girl , who you had no romantic interest in 
But I don't know if it's a real story though
But what if it is
2/10/25, 3:08 PM - Aishwarya: Like lot of things like this that you told here and there,  have made me think that you are a good person 
But I don't have much idea coz I don't know you irl
2/10/25, 3:09 PM - Aishwarya: But what if you are like that 
Like, mostly good like I think you are 

If that's so ,I don't want that person to feel bad 
I don't know if it's making sense
2/10/25, 3:12 PM - Aishwarya: Coz I think you considered me more friend , like bit more closer friend atleast,  than this girl 
( like a girl who thought she was pregnant , that friend )
2/10/25, 3:13 PM - Aishwarya: And if you got bit hurt when she left you 
Maybe you will feel bit hurt when I leave too right 
Like idk 
I think probably you feel more sad for negative things happening ( many people are like that ,but good people in that don't deserve negative things happening to them )
2/10/25, 3:14 PM - Aishwarya: Also ,I don't know if we will be friends again
2/10/25, 3:15 PM - Aishwarya: I don't want you to think about any future friend you make in negative way or have trust issues with them
2/10/25, 3:15 PM - Aishwarya: Like in this case for example
2/10/25, 3:17 PM - Aishwarya: I'm just blocking coz I have to focus my attention and time etc more on studies etc 
Plus coz I haven't moved on fully 
( I have told this many times)

Nothing to do with you not a good friend or anything like that
2/10/25, 3:18 PM - Aishwarya: I'm saying all this thinking you are a good person 
And like such people are more needed 
Maybe some person or friend might need that in future yk
2/10/25, 3:20 PM - Aishwarya: Alright bye
2/10/25, 3:24 PM - Aishwarya: This message was deleted
2/11/25, 8:34 PM - Aishwarya: Hi
2/11/25, 8:34 PM - Aishwarya: This message was deleted
2/11/25, 8:34 PM - Aishwarya: This message was deleted
2/11/25, 8:34 PM - Aishwarya: I believe in affirmations a bit 
So wanted to delete that message 
And send some positive vibes message, as last message , but which is true also
2/11/25, 8:34 PM - Aishwarya: It was nice meeting you and being friends with you 😊
( mainly last year)

And I think you are a good person and a good friend, in general ( even though I have some doubts and all; but doesn't really matter)

9/18/24, 3:23 PM - Sayanth: Food
9/18/24, 3:23 PM - Karthuuu: this is anecdotal btw, but I’ve found that daily use of anti-dandruff shampoo cause d my hair to fall

9/18/24, 3:33 PM - Karthuuu: https://youtube.com/shorts/EivVqpHmG44?si=YVKocLMDRYzU0N3_
9/18/24, 3:58 PM - Karthuuu: i’m back
9/18/24, 3:58 PM - Karthuuu: Now, I’m no expert, so take what I say with a grain of salt…
9/18/24, 3:59 PM - Sayanth: Hi back I'm sayanth
9/18/24, 3:59 PM - Karthuuu: But washing your hair everyday and that too with anti-dandruff shampoo ain’t gonna do any good for your hair
9/18/24, 3:59 PM - Karthuuu: How bad is your dandruff?
9/18/24, 3:59 PM - Sayanth: U are literally a doc but ok
9/18/24, 3:59 PM - Sayanth: Not much bad
9/18/24, 4:00 PM - Sayanth: It's just I hate any kinda dust getting in there
9/18/24, 4:00 PM - Sayanth: Tbh it's not bad at all now
9/18/24, 4:00 PM - Karthuuu: I would suggest that you use the anti-dandruff shampoo maybe once a week and also reduce your hair wash days (with shampoo) to every alternate day.
9/18/24, 4:01 PM - Karthuuu: You can wet your hair in the shower, but you don’t have to wash it everyday
9/18/24, 4:01 PM - Sayanth: Oki
9/18/24, 4:01 PM - Karthuuu: you can get a nice moisturising shampoo which doesn’t have to be too expensive
9/18/24, 4:01 PM - Karthuuu: are you pedantic about having to wash it with soap everyday??
9/18/24, 4:01 PM - Sayanth: Ok I'll add it to the list now
9/18/24, 4:01 PM - Sayanth: Kinda oily hair
9/18/24, 4:01 PM - Sayanth: So
9/18/24, 4:01 PM - Sayanth: But can manage it
9/18/24, 4:02 PM - Karthuuu: dawg, your hair is oily bc ur using drying anti-dandruff shampoo, so ur scalp goes into over drive bc it’s so dry and produces a shit ton of oil
9/18/24, 4:02 PM - Karthuuu: it’s a vicious cycle
9/18/24, 4:03 PM - Karthuuu: to compensate the dryness, hence the oily scalp
9/18/24, 4:03 PM - Karthuuu: and it makes sense that ur face is oily too
9/18/24, 4:03 PM - Sayanth: I see, so moisturize, reduce hair wash, shampoo once in a week,
9/18/24, 4:03 PM - Sayanth: What about conditioner then?
9/18/24, 4:04 PM - Karthuuu: conditioner is good too, it’s moisturising
9/18/24, 4:05 PM - Karthuuu: but make sure it doesn’t go on ur scalp
9/18/24, 4:05 PM - Sayanth: Hm okkkk
9/18/24, 4:05 PM - Karthuuu: cuz that’ll make it oily
9/18/24, 4:05 PM - Sayanth: But everyday or
9/18/24, 4:05 PM - Karthuuu: no, only when u shampoo
9/18/24, 4:05 PM - Sayanth: Oh ok
9/18/24, 4:05 PM - Karthuuu: also hair oiling is good, i think u should try it out again
9/18/24, 4:06 PM - Sayanth: Yup ma'am I'll

2/23/25, 3:06 PM - Sayanth: Wait how much is it gonna be for an X ray there
2/23/25, 3:07 PM - Karthuuu: sometimes it’s covered by the government, so it’s free
2/23/25, 3:08 PM - Sayanth: Else
2/23/25, 3:08 PM - Karthuuu: but it can cost between $50-400 or smth - depends on the body part and type of scan

2/23/25, 3:11 PM - Karthuuu: hmmmm i’m pretty sure this would be paid for by the government, but if i had to pay for it it’d be $300

7/13/25, 11:20 PM - Sayanth: So he had to take break
7/13/25, 11:21 PM - Aunty: director de?
7/13/25, 11:21 PM - Sayanth: So the director who did avenger 2012 and age of ultron took charge

7/13/25, 11:21 PM - Sayanth: And the final product was again messed up
7/13/25, 11:23 PM - Sayanth: Then someone from WB said there's a directors cut of the film different from the ones shown in theaters

7/13/25, 11:24 PM - Sayanth: And finally WB allowed Snyder to release the director cut,  he did some reshoots and all changed a few scenes and then released a whole 4.5 hour movie
7/13/25, 11:25 PM - Sayanth: Which I watched
7/13/25, 11:25 PM - Sayanth: And lemme say it wasn't that great either

12/11/25, 1:03 PM - Gangaaa: She deleted her reddit alle
12/11/25, 1:04 PM - Sayanth: Hey. I wanted to say this directly, but since you did not want to talk to me, I am not going to chase it any further. I know this is probably the lowest point for me. I should have listened to everyone. I should have listened to you when you said you would never feel the same way. None of this is on you. It is my fault. I was depressed and lonely and desperate, and I found comfort in you. Every moment I talked to you felt better than anything I had experienced in a long time. In those first days I would wake up and check my phone to make sure it was real and not a dream. Maybe it was too good to be true.

I do not know if you will ever see this, but I needed to get it out of my head. It is exhausting to hold on to that tiny bit of hope that we might talk again. What hurt me the most was realising that you were putting on an act. Knowing that everything that made me feel happy was something fake was harder to process than the silence itself. It felt like the world flipped in a second. For what it is worth, I trusted you with everything. I know I was not perfect, but I gave what I could.

I never expected things to end like this, but I understand I cannot change anything. You did not need to pretend. I am not going to show up in your life ever again. I just wanted to say goodbye because I still have feelings for you, as pathetic as that might sound. This will be the last time you hear from me. Maybe you will read this, maybe you will not. Either way, saying it gives me some peace. Hope you achieve yout goals . Bye .🙂

5/12/24, 5:11 PM - Alvita 🍣: Today I have to study tomorrow I got an exam
5/12/24, 5:15 PM - Sayanth: Goodluck
5/12/24, 5:19 PM - Alvita 🍣: Thanks dude
5/12/24, 5:19 PM - Sayanth: TTYL go study
5/12/24, 5:19 PM - Alvita 🍣: Yes yes
5/12/24, 5:28 PM - Alvita 🍣: Hsy
5/12/24, 5:28 PM - Alvita 🍣: So
5/12/24, 5:28 PM - Alvita 🍣: I was wondering something
5/12/24, 5:28 PM - Alvita 🍣: I could have Googled it but I thought I'll ask you about it first
5/12/24, 5:28 PM - Alvita 🍣: I want ur opinion
5/12/24, 5:29 PM - Alvita 🍣: What do you think about this
5/12/24, 5:30 PM - Alvita 🍣: Is the future already decided for us like no matter what you do it won't change or the future can be changed like a butterfly effect
5/12/24, 5:30 PM - Alvita 🍣: What do you say
5/12/24, 5:30 PM - Alvita 🍣: Cuz they do say things happen for a reason and sometimes no matter how much you change something it doesn't change
5/12/24, 5:31 PM - Alvita 🍣: But then the other spectrum of it is that you can actually change it if you truly believe in it
5/12/24, 5:32 PM - Alvita 🍣: I mean in psychology what ever I have learnt so far made me truly believe that I can change my entire life if I want even my genes. If I don't want my generation to suffer I can do something now and how we can change our environment in order for us to grow
5/12/24, 5:32 PM - Alvita 🍣: I'm 50/50 on this cuz we can't predict shit
5/12/24, 5:33 PM - Alvita 🍣: Like nature vs nuture shit
5/12/24, 5:34 PM - Alvita 🍣: They say if u grew up from a pretty bad childhood you would likely be a serial killer  but there are so many people who had terrible childhood but they didn't kill anyone or become terrible humans
5/12/24, 5:35 PM - Alvita 🍣: But what about Jeffrey dahmer he was like doomed from the start. His mum would take pain killers when he was in the womb and due to that he was neurologically and psychologically fucked in the head no matter what they did to stop him it didn't work
5/12/24, 5:35 PM - Alvita 🍣: So ya just wanted to know what you think
5/12/24, 5:36 PM - Alvita 🍣: So I know that we have to ability to actually change ourselves and do something like it's not impossible we can change our environment if you have the will but then again what if ur future is already stagnant and no matter what you do ur fate is already sealed
5/12/24, 5:55 PM - Sayanth: Decided no I wouldn't use that word it's more like predetermined by nature/universe
5/12/24, 5:55 PM - Sayanth: Laws of physics
5/12/24, 5:58 PM - Sayanth: Happens for a reason idk but it Happens cuz of a cause everything has a cause and we humans find some kinda logical reasoning or cause effect relation between it
5/12/24, 6:01 PM - Sayanth: OK so from my pov everything is predetermined from the moment the universe was began and it's like we do have choices we have the ability to think and all but we are essentially just some ultra complex robots that are designed to think in a particular way and act accordingly
5/12/24, 6:01 PM - Sayanth: Simply illusion of choice
5/12/24, 6:01 PM - Sayanth: It's like do I have a choice  yup
5/12/24, 6:02 PM - Sayanth: Am I really free I wouldn't say so
5/12/24, 6:02 PM - Sayanth: Can I change my future nope
5/12/24, 6:06 PM - Sayanth: Yeah I'd say that nature vs nurture thing is pretty oversimplification there a lot more factors like trillion of factors like the things we see , the movies we watch , how our parents act, what we are taught , our genes , mental health, the news we read , things we listen to and our surroundings , hormones,  laws of physics like there are countless things that could affect our life
5/12/24, 6:10 PM - Sayanth: But again we can't exactly go on and measure these factors or how much they have affected or how they affect us . It's practically impossible to us to know these things or to know how they affect us how it's gonna change our lives so I say life and our future is pretty much uncertain at least from a human pov . We are not in a controlled environment so 🤷 it's uncertain to us. But at the same time I think what's gonna happen is happen no matter what I do I can't change my fate. But does that mean I'm gonna stop trying obviously no cuz idk what's my future I'm gonna try my best to shape it they way I want it

5/29/24, 2:36 PM - Alvita 🍣: Can't rely on meds
5/29/24, 2:36 PM - Alvita 🍣: Meds will make you feel good temporarily but in the long-run it will crush you
5/29/24, 3:39 PM - Sayanth: Yeah
5/29/24, 3:39 PM - Sayanth: I mean it's not like I got any other option
5/29/24, 11:15 PM - Alvita 🍣: We'll you do
5/29/24, 11:15 PM - Alvita 🍣: You need to work on ur self
5/29/24, 11:15 PM - Alvita 🍣: Meds don't do shit
5/29/24, 11:15 PM - Alvita 🍣: They make you feel like it works
5/29/24, 11:15 PM - Sayanth: No it does work
5/29/24, 11:15 PM - Sayanth: I'm just idk may be go out more often
5/29/24, 11:15 PM - Alvita 🍣: They work ya but I'm saying they aren't permanent
5/29/24, 11:15 PM - Sayanth: And talk to more people
5/29/24, 11:16 PM - Alvita 🍣: See
5/29/24, 11:17 PM - Alvita 🍣: I remember my ma'am saying it in class one day
5/29/24, 11:17 PM - Alvita 🍣: When it comes to meds and stuff many people forget to do the therapy aspect of it. They only rely on the meds
5/29/24, 11:17 PM - Alvita 🍣: So after that people just think meds will only help but later they can't keep up with the dosage and the stress and anxiety increases
5/29/24, 11:18 PM - Alvita 🍣: So in order for you to be fine you have to do both
5/29/24, 11:18 PM - Alvita 🍣: You are fine only because of ur meds
5/29/24, 11:18 PM - Alvita 🍣: That shouldn't be the case like it's basically pointless
5/29/24, 11:18 PM - Alvita 🍣: Then why bother doing that
5/29/24, 11:18 PM - Alvita 🍣: You have to do it on ur own actually start seeing where the problem is and what you can do to get out of it
5/29/24, 11:18 PM - Alvita 🍣: Not saying it's easy I know how fucking hard it is
5/29/24, 11:19 PM - Alvita 🍣: But you have to start somewhere
5/29/24, 11:19 PM - Sayanth: im but for me meds did work its just sometimes some things or songs trigger some old memories of mine
5/29/24, 11:20 PM - Sayanth: im not anxious all the time
5/29/24, 11:20 PM - Sayanth: its just u know for a short time it kinda soikes
5/29/24, 11:20 PM - Sayanth: spikes
5/29/24, 11:20 PM - Alvita 🍣: But like you gotta still do something about it right
5/29/24, 11:20 PM - Alvita 🍣: You gotta manage it someway.
5/29/24, 11:20 PM - Alvita 🍣: Triggers happen
5/29/24, 11:21 PM - Alvita 🍣: But it's up to you to decide how you handle it
5/29/24, 11:21 PM - Alvita 🍣: I saw somewhere
5/29/24, 11:21 PM - Alvita 🍣: If things trigger you or something you gotta do something opposite
5/29/24, 11:21 PM - Sayanth: Like what
5/29/24, 11:22 PM - Alvita 🍣: Like if ur sad and just want to lay in bed immediately get up and walk around
5/29/24, 11:22 PM - Alvita 🍣: Or if ur sad and listening to sad songs immediately listen to happy songs
5/29/24, 11:22 PM - Alvita 🍣: Cuz ur telling ur brain to stop making patterns
5/29/24, 11:22 PM - Alvita 🍣: Ur brain loves sabotage things so by doing this you are tricking ur brain into not falling into those patterns
5/29/24, 11:23 PM - Alvita 🍣: You get it?
5/29/24, 11:23 PM - Sayanth: Mm yeah my therapist had given me some exercises to break the pattern
5/29/24, 11:23 PM - Alvita 🍣: Tell me some
5/29/24, 11:29 PM - Sayanth: Oh it was just an A4 paper with some name colors listed
5/29/24, 11:30 PM - Sayanth: But each name would be on different color
5/29/24, 11:30 PM - Sayanth: Like if it's red it will be written in green
5/29/24, 11:30 PM - Sayanth: And green would be in yellow
5/29/24, 11:30 PM - Sayanth: So I have read the names first
5/29/24, 11:30 PM - Sayanth: Then just colors

6/2/24, 10:10 PM - Sayanth: OK I could be wrong but from what she said
6/2/24, 10:11 PM - Sayanth: She sounds like someone who's from lower caste and dark skinned and got discriminated a lot because of that I guess
6/2/24, 10:11 PM - Sayanth: I mean discriminated because of her skin color
6/2/24, 10:11 PM - Sayanth: Or at least she thinks so
6/2/24, 10:12 PM - Sayanth: Cuz she's obsessed with how we see dark skinned people
6/2/24, 10:12 PM - Sayanth: She was asking a lot of questions about skin color
6/2/24, 10:12 PM - Sayanth: And that guy was kinda hard-core casteist
6/2/24, 10:13 PM - Sayanth: And she had asked me if I was upper caste
6/2/24, 10:13 PM - Alvita 🍣: Yikes
6/2/24, 10:13 PM - Sayanth: Because of my name
6/2/24, 10:13 PM - Alvita 🍣: Ohhhh

6/2/24, 10:13 PM - Alvita 🍣: Cuz why caste came in between
6/2/24, 10:14 PM - Alvita 🍣: I think she should ignore that dude and focus on her exams
6/2/24, 10:14 PM - Sayanth: Yup
6/2/24, 10:14 PM - Alvita 🍣: Fighting with people over caste and skin tone will do nothing but annoyance
6/2/24, 10:14 PM - Sayanth: But as every other person she too went back to him to talk
6/2/24, 10:14 PM - Sayanth: After initially ghosting him
6/2/24, 10:14 PM - Sayanth: Yup
6/2/24, 10:14 PM - Alvita 🍣: It hurt her
6/2/24, 10:14 PM - Sayanth: And he didn't change a bit
6/2/24, 10:14 PM - Alvita 🍣: She wants to prove a point to him
6/2/24, 10:15 PM - Sayanth: W8
6/2/24, 10:15 PM - Alvita 🍣: But the thing is his opinion won't change
6/2/24, 10:15 PM - Alvita 🍣: Ya

6/4/24, 8:37 PM - Sayanth: Well there was this girl
6/4/24, 8:37 PM - Sayanth: So basically I was in 11th
6/4/24, 8:37 PM - Sayanth: And I was going through my cousin's insta stories
6/4/24, 8:38 PM - Sayanth: And there was this picture some girls her classmates
6/4/24, 8:38 PM - Sayanth: They were all mentioned in that story and one of those usernames kinda clicked in my brain
6/4/24, 8:38 PM - Sayanth: I checked her account cuz of that
6/4/24, 8:38 PM - Sayanth: And I swear I don't usually do that
6/4/24, 8:39 PM - Sayanth: And it was all relatable to me
6/4/24, 8:39 PM - Sayanth: So I replied to a story of her
6/4/24, 8:39 PM - Sayanth: And we talked a bit
6/4/24, 8:39 PM - Sayanth: Became kinda close
6/4/24, 8:39 PM - Sayanth: As friends
6/4/24, 8:40 PM - Sayanth: Then after few months she started turning into some toxic feminist kinda thing
6/4/24, 8:40 PM - Sayanth: As in she would often put stories saying that all men are rapists
6/4/24, 8:40 PM - Sayanth: Kinda like Nazis
6/4/24, 8:41 PM - Sayanth: Except instead of Aryan superiority
6/4/24, 8:41 PM - Sayanth: It's female superiority
6/4/24, 8:41 PM - Sayanth: I used keep my mouth shut about all that
6/4/24, 8:41 PM - Sayanth: Cuz she had some really bad experiences from her relative when she was young
6/4/24, 8:42 PM - Sayanth: At least that's what she said
6/4/24, 8:42 PM - Sayanth: Now I kinda doubt if any of those things she said were real
6/4/24, 8:43 PM - Sayanth: Also she claims she has trauma
6/4/24, 8:43 PM - Sayanth: And sees a therapist

6/5/24, 10:56 PM - Alvita 🍣: Ahhhhh

6/5/24, 10:57 PM - Sayanth: Im not saying I'm
6/5/24, 10:57 PM - Sayanth: But I might be
6/5/24, 10:57 PM - Alvita 🍣: how did you realise you were asexual?
6/5/24, 10:58 PM - Sayanth: Because

6/5/24, 11:05 PM - Sayanth: Yup
6/5/24, 11:06 PM - Sayanth: So basically even when I was head over heels for her I didn't feel any attraction towards her in a sexual way
6/6/24, 12:55 AM - Sayanth: Did I piss u off or anything
6/6/24, 1:00 AM - Alvita 🍣: Heyy
6/6/24, 1:00 AM - Alvita 🍣: Oh

6/6/24, 1:00 AM - Alvita 🍣: Sorry I wasn't texting you
6/6/24, 1:00 AM - Alvita 🍣: I just finished the show I was watching
6/6/24, 1:00 AM - Sayanth: Yeah another important thing
6/6/24, 1:01 AM - Sayanth: Our recent election was manipulated
6/6/24, 1:01 AM - Sayanth: By some foreign entities
6/6/24, 1:01 AM - Sayanth: DisinfoLab had published an expose
6/6/24, 1:02 AM - Sayanth: And it's huge like damn I wasn't expecting it to be this long

6/6/24, 1:07 AM - Sayanth: It's too long
6/6/24, 1:07 AM - Alvita 🍣: Could sum it up for me please
6/6/24, 1:08 AM - Sayanth: It'd be better if u read it on ur own
6/6/24, 1:08 AM - Sayanth: I could be biased
6/6/24, 1:08 AM - Sayanth: But from what I read
6/6/24, 1:08 AM - Sayanth: There were too many foreign funding to some media outlets
6/6/24, 1:09 AM - Sayanth: And Some particular universities
6/6/24, 1:09 AM - Alvita 🍣: But why
6/6/24, 1:12 AM - Sayanth: Well obviously west wasn't happy at how india is moving forward that was obvious as it can get
6/6/24, 1:12 AM - Sayanth: Also remember for the past decade we had a stable Government
6/6/24, 1:12 AM - Sayanth: As of now we don't
6/6/24, 1:12 AM - Alvita 🍣: This is so messed up
6/6/24, 1:12 AM - Sayanth: Thus our market crashed
6/6/24, 1:13 AM - Sayanth: Tbh u should have seen that lol I almost lost 5k last day
6/6/24, 1:13 AM - Alvita 🍣: That's why
6/6/24, 1:13 AM - Alvita 🍣: My sister was saying because of the election the the sales dropped
6/6/24, 1:13 AM - Alvita 🍣: I thought that was normal for some reason
6/6/24, 1:13 AM - Alvita 🍣: Jesus Christ
6/6/24, 1:13 AM - Alvita 🍣: Need to read this
6/6/24, 1:15 AM - Sayanth: Not exactly because of election but see if u had seen the live crash and boom u would have understood it better it was like when NDA crossed 300 at first market boomed then when INDIA started gaining seats market started to crash
6/6/24, 1:15 AM - Sayanth: And when INDIA crossed NDAs total no of seats market crash peaked there
6/6/24, 1:16 AM - Sayanth: Then again when NDA started gaining seats market kinda started to recover
6/6/24, 1:18 AM - Alvita 🍣: Oh that's weird
6/6/24, 1:19 AM - Sayanth: Also remember Pegasus

6/6/24, 1:20 AM - Alvita 🍣: Was going to say mystical creature
6/6/24, 1:20 AM - Sayanth: There were few allegations that GOI of India was using it to hunt down Critics
6/6/24, 1:20 AM - Sayanth: But
6/6/24, 1:21 AM - Sayanth: Also they accused GOI of spying on citizens
6/6/24, 1:21 AM - Sayanth: Which tbh is kinda true else there wouldn't be the need of RAW or any other investigation agencies of such
6/6/24, 1:23 AM - Alvita 🍣: Omg
6/6/24, 1:23 AM - Sayanth: But the whole rumour was started by Newyork Time and they have pretty much a good track record of making up fake stories and then in india it was The Wire who was propagating such stories
6/6/24, 1:23 AM - Sayanth: And here comes the twist
6/6/24, 1:24 AM - Sayanth: The wire was founded by siddharth varadarajan who is a US citizen
6/6/24, 1:25 AM - Sayanth: And they couldn't provide any evidence or anything even remotely proves the allegations
6/6/24, 1:25 AM - Sayanth: This is incident one
6/6/24, 1:26 AM - Alvita 🍣: Ehhh

6/6/24, 1:30 AM - Sayanth: Basically they had few article written about it alleging that The current GOI the BJP was give some special tool by Meta/Facebook  to spread propaganda, Ban critics and all
6/6/24, 1:30 AM - Sayanth: Again turned out to be fake
6/6/24, 1:31 AM - Alvita 🍣: I'm reading some articles

6/12/24, 9:25 PM - Alvita 🍣: Tbh
6/12/24, 9:26 PM - Alvita 🍣: I'll choose bear
6/12/24, 9:26 PM - Alvita 🍣: You know why?
6/12/24, 9:26 PM - Sayanth: Why
6/12/24, 9:26 PM - Alvita 🍣: I love bears 🤣
6/12/24, 9:26 PM - Sayanth: Who's the first?
6/12/24, 9:26 PM - Sayanth: No seriously
6/12/24, 9:26 PM - Alvita 🍣: One of my friend
6/12/24, 9:27 PM - Alvita 🍣: Cuz she doesn't like that whole thing
6/12/24, 9:27 PM - Alvita 🍣: Ok wait
6/12/24, 9:27 PM - Alvita 🍣: Actually I have no idea
6/12/24, 9:27 PM - Alvita 🍣: I'm still in debate about it
6/12/24, 9:28 PM - Sayanth: Dude
6/12/24, 9:28 PM - Alvita 🍣: Cuz I know the reason why people will choose the bear over the men
6/12/24, 9:28 PM - Sayanth: Ok hear me out
6/12/24, 9:28 PM - Sayanth: There's a 90+ percent chance a bear will kill u
6/12/24, 9:29 PM - Sayanth: But with men it's less than 10 tbh
6/12/24, 9:29 PM - Sayanth: I did the math myself
6/12/24, 9:29 PM - Alvita 🍣: Damn
6/12/24, 9:29 PM - Sayanth: Tbh the result  was less than 0.8 percent
6/12/24, 9:29 PM - Sayanth: But again no one would believe u
6/12/24, 9:29 PM - Sayanth: If u said that
6/12/24, 9:30 PM - Sayanth: So the thing is I put a story a funny reel gandalf and frodo laughing
6/12/24, 9:30 PM - Alvita 🍣: Ok ok so I watched a video about this situation and still confused cuz they did have good points as to why they would choose a bear over a man
6/12/24, 9:31 PM - Sayanth: With the headline woman got fatally attacked by bear
6/12/24, 9:31 PM - Sayanth: It was funny
6/12/24, 9:31 PM - Sayanth: At least to ne
6/12/24, 9:31 PM - Sayanth: Me
6/12/24, 9:31 PM - Sayanth: So she replied
6/12/24, 9:31 PM - Sayanth: Why is it funny ?
6/12/24, 9:31 PM - Sayanth: I said cuz of the whole bear vs men argument
6/12/24, 9:32 PM - Sayanth: And she pulled a sexual assault statistics of us
6/12/24, 9:32 PM - Sayanth: California to be precise
6/12/24, 9:33 PM - Sayanth: And I told her that it's misandrist
6/12/24, 9:33 PM - Sayanth: Cuz if I said all women are gold diggers that'd be misogynistic
6/12/24, 9:34 PM - Sayanth: Sure there are women who are gold diggers and I'd be careful about that everytime I meet someone in a romantic sense I'd try to make sure they are not gold diggers or psychopaths or anything
6/12/24, 9:35 PM - Sayanth: Surely no one would want to be with a bad person
6/12/24, 9:36 PM - Sayanth: Same with men there are men who are rapists and killers and psychopaths but then again saying "men are dangerous or potential rapists" that's the same as saying women are gold diggers or cheaters"
6/12/24, 9:37 PM - Sayanth: Yeah I understand why one would not choose a stranger I'd be careful too
6/12/24, 9:37 PM - Alvita 🍣: Hey bro I'll have dinner and text you later. You continue texting I'll tell you my response later
6/12/24, 9:37 PM - Sayanth: Yeah
6/12/24, 11:44 PM - Alvita 🍣: Hey
6/12/24, 11:52 PM - Sayanth: Yeah
6/12/24, 11:52 PM - Alvita 🍣: Sorry I was watching a movie with my sister so i couldn't text
6/12/24, 11:52 PM - Alvita 🍣: Wait
6/12/24, 11:52 PM - Alvita 🍣: I'll just reply to ur message
6/12/24, 11:53 PM - Alvita 🍣: So ur conclusion is why woman are going for bear right
6/12/24, 11:53 PM - Sayanth: Yeah
6/12/24, 11:53 PM - Alvita 🍣: Who would you choose?
6/12/24, 11:53 PM - Sayanth: But it's not right generalize men or women
6/12/24, 11:53 PM - Alvita 🍣: That's true
6/12/24, 11:54 PM - Alvita 🍣: Wait I want to ask one question before I'll tell my thing
6/12/24, 11:54 PM - Sayanth: Tbh I wouldn't choose bear nor men
6/12/24, 11:54 PM - Sayanth: Yeah
6/12/24, 11:54 PM - Alvita 🍣: Same
6/12/24, 11:54 PM - Alvita 🍣: Cuz I saw this question asked a lot
6/12/24, 11:54 PM - Alvita 🍣: Would you let ur daughter be with the bear or man?
6/12/24, 11:55 PM - Sayanth: If thats an ultimatum
6/12/24, 11:55 PM - Sayanth: Man of course
6/12/24, 11:55 PM - Sayanth: Else none
6/12/24, 11:55 PM - Alvita 🍣: See
6/12/24, 11:55 PM - Alvita 🍣: Even I'm in the middle of it
6/12/24, 11:56 PM - Alvita 🍣: For some woman who were sexually assaulted they will definitely choose the bear
6/12/24, 11:56 PM - Sayanth: That's still stupid tho
6/12/24, 11:56 PM - Alvita 🍣: And i have seen so many things thrown around like how a bear would just straight out kill you not assualt you or
6/12/24, 11:56 PM - Alvita 🍣: Being attacked by a bear will be believable than being raped by the man
6/12/24, 11:56 PM - Alvita 🍣: And blah blah blah
6/12/24, 11:56 PM - Sayanth: They are not familiar with bears I guess
6/12/24, 11:57 PM - Alvita 🍣: I don't think so too
6/12/24, 11:57 PM - Alvita 🍣: But the thing is
6/12/24, 11:57 PM - Alvita 🍣: What ever the choice is people should not group one gender
6/12/24, 11:57 PM - Alvita 🍣: I don't like that
6/12/24, 11:57 PM - Sayanth: Yeah
6/12/24, 11:57 PM - Alvita 🍣: People have their reasons
6/12/24, 11:57 PM - Sayanth: Exactly
6/12/24, 11:57 PM - Alvita 🍣: But now it became a trend to say men are trash
6/12/24, 11:57 PM - Alvita 🍣: There are some woman will say men are trash but not my man and stuff
6/12/24, 11:58 PM - Alvita 🍣: You are still generalising shit
6/12/24, 11:58 PM - Alvita 🍣: I understand how annoying this is
6/12/24, 11:58 PM - Sayanth: If someone doesn't want to be near me because of safety issues fine understandable nothing wrong with that entirely upto them
6/12/24, 11:58 PM - Sayanth: But my issues is that I can't laugh at that joke
6/12/24, 11:58 PM - Sayanth: That's what she said
6/12/24, 11:59 PM - Alvita 🍣: What did she exactly day
6/12/24, 11:59 PM - Alvita 🍣: Say*
6/12/24, 11:59 PM - Alvita 🍣: You know that lady who got attacked by the bear right
6/12/24, 11:59 PM - Alvita 🍣: She said she will still choose the bear
6/12/24, 11:59 PM - Sayanth: Yeah
6/12/24, 11:59 PM - Sayanth: Misogynistic
6/13/24, 12:00 AM - Alvita 🍣: What did you say tho
6/13/24, 12:00 AM - Alvita 🍣: For her to throw those words
6/13/24, 12:00 AM - Alvita 🍣: This word has lost meaning
6/13/24, 12:00 AM - Sayanth: Me calling that generalization as misandristic
6/13/24, 12:02 AM - Sayanth: Told I wouldn't generalize women that way so I think I deserve the same respect I give everyone. + I never supported any kinda suppression of rights or anything. So if someone groups me into something I don't belong or someyhing I despise I think I've the right to call out that <This message was edited>
6/13/24, 12:02 AM - Alvita 🍣: Ya exactly
6/13/24, 12:02 AM - Alvita 🍣: Its the same logic
6/13/24, 12:03 AM - Alvita 🍣: She can say ur height is bad but the minute you say she is fat she will get offended shit
6/13/24, 12:04 AM - Alvita 🍣: Women like her are the reason that women who get treated harshly by men are not seriously
6/13/24, 12:05 AM - Alvita 🍣: I'm so done with gender debate
6/13/24, 12:05 AM - Alvita 🍣: Man it so annoying ahhhhh
6/13/24, 12:05 AM - Sayanth: Same
6/13/24, 12:05 AM - Alvita 🍣: Everything is men are trash and women are victims
6/13/24, 12:05 AM - Alvita 🍣: But actual important news no one cares
6/13/24, 12:07 AM - Sayanth: Yup
6/13/24, 12:07 AM - Alvita 🍣: So now she unfollowed you?
6/13/24, 12:07 AM - Sayanth: Yup
6/13/24, 12:07 AM - Alvita 🍣: And why she called you delusional again
6/13/24, 12:08 AM - Sayanth: Dude I didn't even call her delusional I didn't even question her beliefs
6/13/24, 12:08 AM - Sayanth: Yeah that specific part
6/13/24, 12:08 AM - Sayanth: .
6/13/24, 12:09 AM - Alvita 🍣: Why us why couldn't she put for India and stuff
6/13/24, 12:09 AM - Alvita 🍣: She can't even debate properly
6/13/24, 12:09 AM - Sayanth: So I did math with those numbers to calculate the probability
6/13/24, 12:09 AM - Alvita 🍣: I'm telling you this girl is chronically online
6/13/24, 12:09 AM - Sayanth: Nope she just assumes everything and then accuse me of assuming
6/13/24, 12:10 AM - Alvita 🍣: Goodness she is insufferable
6/13/24, 12:10 AM - Sayanth: And when I did
6/13/24, 12:10 AM - Sayanth: The percentage of reported rapists (13,909) out of the total male population in California (19.71 million) is approximately 0.071%.
6/13/24, 12:11 AM - Alvita 🍣: You know the funny thing is isn't the bear the national flag of California
6/13/24, 12:11 AM - Alvita 🍣: Damn
6/13/24, 12:11 AM - Sayanth: She said most men are like that
6/13/24, 12:11 AM - Alvita 🍣: Then she should stop talking to you
6/13/24, 12:11 AM - Alvita 🍣: What took her that long
6/13/24, 12:12 AM - Sayanth: I get it . It's like yeah we get scared of snakes whether it's venomous or not
6/13/24, 12:12 AM - Alvita 🍣: If she thinks that then her dad her brother her cousins are all that
6/13/24, 12:12 AM - Alvita 🍣: She should just become a monk
6/13/24, 12:12 AM - Alvita 🍣: Ya i get it to
6/13/24, 12:12 AM - Sayanth: At this point I want to be a monk

6/13/24, 12:13 AM - Alvita 🍣: Until it wasn't
6/13/24, 12:13 AM - Alvita 🍣: She didn't even try to understand ur side to this
6/13/24, 12:13 AM - Alvita 🍣: But but
6/13/24, 12:13 AM - Alvita 🍣: If ur an alien starseed ur supposed to be empathetic and understanding right

6/29/24, 8:22 PM - Alvita 🍣: I know that but like the anxiety surrounds her
6/29/24, 8:22 PM - Alvita 🍣: I think you are insecurity regarding her
6/29/24, 8:23 PM - Alvita 🍣: You are afraid to the point of over analysing and overthinking the situation
6/29/24, 8:24 PM - Alvita 🍣: If this anxiety keeps getting stronger you will end up loosing her
6/29/24, 8:24 PM - Alvita 🍣: You are attached to her which is bad
6/29/24, 8:24 PM - Alvita 🍣: You want her to be with you but you want to avoid her at the same time
6/29/24, 8:25 PM - Sayanth: Yeah yeah

6/29/24, 8:25 PM - Sayanth: Which I don't want to
6/29/24, 8:26 PM - Sayanth: And if that happens i don't wanna get hurt

7/7/24, 1:33 AM - Alvita 🍣: Werinckne
7/7/24, 1:33 AM - Alvita 🍣: Wait the spelling is wrong
7/7/24, 1:34 AM - Alvita 🍣: <Media omitted>
7/7/24, 1:34 AM - Alvita 🍣: He is the main head of the corporation
7/7/24, 1:34 AM - Alvita 🍣: He is the Walt Disney of the experiment
7/7/24, 1:34 AM - Sayanth: Oh
7/7/24, 1:34 AM - Alvita 🍣: He was pronounced dead after the interview was done about his mk ultra
7/7/24, 1:35 AM - Alvita 🍣: Buttttttt

7/7/24, 1:35 AM - Alvita 🍣: The walrider
7/7/24, 1:35 AM - Alvita 🍣: Has an host already
7/7/24, 1:35 AM - Alvita 🍣: His name is Billy
7/7/24, 1:35 AM - Alvita 🍣: Are you getting confused?
7/7/24, 1:35 AM - Sayanth: Nooo
7/7/24, 1:35 AM - Sayanth: No
7/7/24, 1:35 AM - Sayanth: Go on

7/7/24, 1:36 AM - Alvita 🍣: Ok so
7/7/24, 1:36 AM - Alvita 🍣: So Billy actually was a good host for the walrider
7/7/24, 1:36 AM - Alvita 🍣: <Media omitted>
7/7/24, 1:36 AM - Alvita 🍣: Because he was known to lucid dreaming
7/7/24, 1:37 AM - Alvita 🍣: Which was needed for the experiments
7/7/24, 1:37 AM - Alvita 🍣: They induced the lucid dreaming on the patients but Billy did it without it
7/7/24, 1:37 AM - Alvita 🍣: His story is kinda sad
7/7/24, 1:37 AM - Sayanth: Why
7/7/24, 1:37 AM - Alvita 🍣: He was given away by his mother
7/7/24, 1:37 AM - Alvita 🍣: Cuz they thought he was crazy for lucid dreaming
7/7/24, 1:38 AM - Sayanth: Oh
7/7/24, 1:38 AM - Alvita 🍣: And the corporation paid her with money and she bought jewellery with it
7/7/24, 1:38 AM - Alvita 🍣: She couldn't visit him because they said to her the experiment can fail
7/7/24, 1:38 AM - Alvita 🍣: And to him they said she died of heart attack
7/7/24, 1:38 AM - Alvita 🍣: There is an ending to that story but I won't say it now
7/7/24, 1:38 AM - Alvita 🍣: In the end I'll say
7/7/24, 1:38 AM - Alvita 🍣: So now
7/7/24, 1:39 AM - Alvita 🍣: Miles he ends up in this weird tunnel
7/7/24, 1:39 AM - Alvita 🍣: And he sees the symbol of the corporation
7/7/24, 1:39 AM - Alvita 🍣: He finds the room where they do the experiments
7/7/24, 1:39 AM - Alvita 🍣: Nowwww
7/7/24, 1:39 AM - Alvita 🍣: Miles switches this off
7/7/24, 1:40 AM - Alvita 🍣: And it kills Billy
7/7/24, 1:40 AM - Alvita 🍣: Now the walrider is loose
7/7/24, 1:40 AM - Sayanth: Oh
7/7/24, 1:40 AM - Alvita 🍣: And also *drum roll*
7/7/24, 1:40 AM - Alvita 🍣: Our Walt Disney guy is alive
7/7/24, 1:40 AM - Sayanth: Yeah knew it
7/7/24, 1:40 AM - Alvita 🍣: He was still alive doing experiments
7/7/24, 1:41 AM - Alvita 🍣: That man helped the Nazis escape and shit so pretty shitty guy
7/7/24, 1:41 AM - Alvita 🍣: Ok now wait for this
7/7/24, 1:41 AM - Alvita 🍣: Chris walker
7/7/24, 1:41 AM - Alvita 🍣: Finds out and almost kills you
7/7/24, 1:41 AM - Alvita 🍣: That time the walrider kills him
7/7/24, 1:42 AM - Alvita 🍣: <Media omitted>
7/7/24, 1:42 AM - Sayanth: Whutttt
7/7/24, 1:42 AM - Alvita 🍣: Didn't get it?
7/7/24, 1:42 AM - Sayanth: So it's invisible
7/7/24, 1:42 AM - Alvita 🍣: Kinda ya
7/7/24, 1:42 AM - Alvita 🍣: It's like invisible but you can still see it
7/7/24, 1:43 AM - Sayanth: Got it
7/7/24, 1:43 AM - Sayanth: Translucent
7/7/24, 1:43 AM - Alvita 🍣: Now that I saw this that scene makes it funny
7/7/24, 1:43 AM - Alvita 🍣: Kinda yah
7/7/24, 1:43 AM - Alvita 🍣: The patients thought it was a ghost
7/7/24, 1:43 AM - Alvita 🍣: But it isn't some supernatural thing
7/7/24, 1:43 AM - Alvita 🍣: It's made up of these weird nanoscopic machines
7/7/24, 1:43 AM - Alvita 🍣: Ok now
7/7/24, 1:44 AM - Sayanth: Go onn
7/7/24, 1:44 AM - Alvita 🍣: The wernicke
7/7/24, 1:44 AM - Alvita 🍣: And his guards try shooting you because if this gets out then the corporation is screwed
7/7/24, 1:44 AM - Alvita 🍣: But immediately walrider takes miles has host
7/7/24, 1:44 AM - Alvita 🍣: And he ends up killing everyone
7/7/24, 1:45 AM - Alvita 🍣: So our best character is the new walrider
7/7/24, 1:45 AM - Alvita 🍣: That's the end of the first game
7/7/24, 1:45 AM - Alvita 🍣: Feel really bad for him
7/7/24, 1:45 AM - Sayanth: Oh
7/7/24, 1:45 AM - Sayanth: So he never really leaves the asylum
7/7/24, 1:45 AM - Alvita 🍣: For today I'll say about the whistle blower and Tomo I'll tell you about the 2nd outlast
7/7/24, 1:46 AM - Alvita 🍣: He can

7/7/24, 1:46 AM - Sayanth: Okkkk
7/7/24, 1:46 AM - Alvita 🍣: He is like an hero
7/7/24, 1:46 AM - Alvita 🍣: Wait I forgot one thing
7/7/24, 1:46 AM - Alvita 🍣: Chris walker
7/7/24, 1:46 AM - Alvita 🍣: He actually is an antihero
7/7/24, 1:46 AM - Alvita 🍣: He kills everyone in the asylum because he doesn't want the walrider to get a host
7/7/24, 1:47 AM - Alvita 🍣: That's why he is behind us cuz we have seen a lot of shit in that asylum
7/7/24, 1:47 AM - Alvita 🍣: But he failed
7/7/24, 1:47 AM - Alvita 🍣: Before we go further what do you think about the first one so far
7/7/24, 1:47 AM - Sayanth: Great

7/7/24, 1:48 AM - Alvita 🍣: So the dlc comes first right now
7/7/24, 1:49 AM - Alvita 🍣: We play as waylon who sends that message to miles about the asylum
7/7/24, 1:49 AM - Sayanth: Oh
7/7/24, 1:49 AM - Alvita 🍣: He works there so you will see more of the experiments happening
7/7/24, 1:49 AM - Alvita 🍣: Around that time one patient is being subjected to the experiments and he tries to run away and comes close to you

7/7/24, 1:53 AM - Alvita 🍣: And now you have to escape
7/7/24, 1:54 AM - Alvita 🍣: You will find this creepy cannibal man who wants to eat you and cook you in a furnace
7/7/24, 1:54 AM - Alvita 🍣: The things Waylon saw was minor to what miles experienced
7/7/24, 1:55 AM - Alvita 🍣: But still both are traumatizing to say the least
7/7/24, 1:55 AM - Sayanth: Oh
7/7/24, 1:55 AM - Alvita 🍣: Now our Eddie comes
7/7/24, 1:55 AM - Alvita 🍣: <Media omitted>
7/7/24, 1:55 AM - Alvita 🍣: He looks like this now

7/7/24, 2:01 AM - Alvita 🍣: Come to the building to kill everyone so that they can bury the horrors that happened here
7/7/24, 2:01 AM - Alvita 🍣: And while you are trying to leave you can hear two men talking about Richard trager
7/7/24, 2:02 AM - Alvita 🍣: Like who could do this to him
7/7/24, 2:02 AM - Alvita 🍣: And when ur leaving ur shitty boss is right out the door
7/7/24, 2:02 AM - Alvita 🍣: He lunches at you and immediately the walrider kills him
7/7/24, 2:02 AM - Alvita 🍣: The walrider is miles
7/7/24, 2:02 AM - Alvita 🍣: He wants Waylon to escape and upload the camera footage and expose the corporation
7/7/24, 2:03 AM - Alvita 🍣: The ending of Waylon is that he will be chased by the corporation for the rest of his life
7/7/24, 2:03 AM - Alvita 🍣: Now what happened to miles
7/7/24, 2:03 AM - Alvita 🍣: The walrider has some essence of Billy still
7/7/24, 2:03 AM - Alvita 🍣: So Billy wants to see his mother
7/7/24, 2:04 AM - Alvita 🍣: This is from the comic

7/7/24, 2:04 AM - Alvita 🍣: And around that time the corporation comes to meet the mother
7/7/24, 2:04 AM - Alvita 🍣: They ask her about miles and Billy
7/7/24, 2:04 AM - Alvita 🍣: Around this time the mom says why she gave Billy away and how she could never visit him
7/7/24, 2:05 AM - Alvita 🍣: That time Billy Destroys all her jewelry and says he can make her happy
7/7/24, 2:05 AM - Alvita 🍣: Buttttt

7/7/24, 2:05 AM - Alvita 🍣: She only wanted money she never cared about her son
7/7/24, 2:05 AM - Alvita 🍣: Once Billy found out
7/7/24, 2:05 AM - Alvita 🍣: He ripped her into pieces
7/7/24, 2:05 AM - Alvita 🍣: And then the walrider took host of an ant colony

7/9/24, 8:37 PM - Sayanth: Um yeah understandable
7/9/24, 8:38 PM - Sayanth: You aren't worthless
7/9/24, 8:38 PM - Alvita 🍣: I don't know why I'm feeling this like things are going good. I'll be going to Goa in August. New people have come
7/9/24, 8:38 PM - Sayanth: Bro you are like my aaaah idk how do I say it

7/9/24, 8:38 PM - Sayanth: My guardian angel 😇
7/9/24, 8:38 PM - Alvita 🍣: I was frustrated
7/9/24, 8:39 PM - Sayanth: Why
7/9/24, 8:39 PM - Sayanth: What was it
7/9/24, 8:39 PM - Alvita 🍣: Thanks for saying this
7/9/24, 8:39 PM - Sayanth: Yess

7/9/24, 8:39 PM - Sayanth: Also I wanna visit mangalore and since u are there u can show me the places

7/9/24, 8:48 PM - Sayanth: W8 is that girl ? Lorena
7/9/24, 9:01 PM - Alvita 🍣: Nah
7/9/24, 9:01 PM - Alvita 🍣: I don't care about her
7/9/24, 9:01 PM - Alvita 🍣: Sorry I left
7/9/24, 9:02 PM - Alvita 🍣: Out of nowhere I started crying and my sister freaked out
7/9/24, 9:02 PM - Alvita 🍣: So this girl was in my group her name is Michelle
7/9/24, 9:02 PM - Alvita 🍣: So me and my friend recently found out she is a bitch
7/9/24, 9:02 PM - Alvita 🍣: And actually a horrible person.
7/9/24, 9:03 PM - Alvita 🍣: Just in general I don't have any sympathy for this girl. She doesn't care about others and her insecurity should be entertained
7/9/24, 9:03 PM - Alvita 🍣: Knowing that i don't have to see her I was glad and she did apologize to me but not to my friend pissed me off
7/9/24, 9:04 PM - Alvita 🍣: It wasn't even an apology it was just blaming us for everything and playing the victim card
7/9/24, 9:04 PM - Alvita 🍣: Now that I'm going back to college
7/9/24, 9:04 PM - Alvita 🍣: I didn't feel anything at first. But then I realised it's better I talk to her and just move on
7/9/24, 9:05 PM - Alvita 🍣: Still she acted like none of it was her fault and I told her to drop the whole matter and after that we had a good conversation
7/9/24, 9:05 PM - Alvita 🍣: But after that for some reason I was frustrated
7/9/24, 9:05 PM - Alvita 🍣: Really frustrated. While playing dying light I was so mad
7/9/24, 9:05 PM - Alvita 🍣: Even gta 5 i felt super stressed out
7/9/24, 9:10 PM - Sayanth: Ok I get it
7/9/24, 9:10 PM - Sayanth: I can relate to that
7/9/24, 9:10 PM - Sayanth: I'm going through something like that rn
7/9/24, 9:10 PM - Sayanth: She still there ?
7/9/24, 9:11 PM - Alvita 🍣: Tell me
7/9/24, 9:11 PM - Alvita 🍣: Yes
7/9/24, 9:11 PM - Alvita 🍣: And it feels like she never faced any consequences
7/9/24, 9:11 PM - Alvita 🍣: Like in the end everything is favouring her
7/9/24, 9:12 PM - Alvita 🍣: For a long time I was feeling optimistic like I had this power that I can be resilient
7/9/24, 9:12 PM - Alvita 🍣: Cuz i really felt the universe has a purpose for me to choose Aloysius for a reason
7/9/24, 9:12 PM - Alvita 🍣: And I wasnt feeling like something was wrong. I was full in trust
7/9/24, 9:12 PM - Alvita 🍣: When I felt good in that way things were going great
7/9/24, 9:13 PM - Alvita 🍣: But yesterday I crashed and burned and my mind is questioning evrything
7/9/24, 9:14 PM - Sayanth: I believe that too
7/9/24, 9:14 PM - Sayanth: No it's ok I can manage it myself
7/9/24, 9:14 PM - Sayanth: U gotta focus on yurself now
7/9/24, 9:15 PM - Sayanth: Well who tf cares about her
7/9/24, 9:15 PM - Sayanth: Just don't
7/9/24, 9:15 PM - Sayanth: What if it favors her or not
7/9/24, 9:15 PM - Sayanth: We don't have to care about her
7/9/24, 9:15 PM - Alvita 🍣: And the fact that charan is coming like what the hell. I was really thinking he will be in chennai enjoying his life there. The fact that he ditched that place and chose aloy was not some random things
7/9/24, 9:15 PM - Alvita 🍣: Thing*
7/9/24, 9:15 PM - Sayanth: Yeah I guess so
7/9/24, 9:16 PM - Alvita 🍣: I don't want to care about either but like for some reason she just brought back my insecurities
7/9/24, 9:16 PM - Sayanth: Hey u are just being anxious over something so silly but I can relate to that as an experienced anxious person
7/9/24, 9:16 PM - Alvita 🍣: I know so many exciting things are going to start yet still I'm feeling weird
7/9/24, 9:17 PM - Sayanth: Did she say something to you
7/9/24, 9:17 PM - Sayanth: Oh fk her
7/9/24, 9:17 PM - Alvita 🍣: It's her working behind the scenes that caused a lot of issues
7/9/24, 9:17 PM - Alvita 🍣: She will never change
7/9/24, 9:17 PM - Alvita 🍣: I wanted to confront her and just say everything and block her for good
7/9/24, 9:17 PM - Sayanth: So is she gonna be in ur class ?
7/9/24, 9:17 PM - Alvita 🍣: But not so soon
7/9/24, 9:17 PM - Alvita 🍣: Yes
7/9/24, 9:18 PM - Alvita 🍣: She was in my class since I was in puc
7/9/24, 9:18 PM - Sayanth: Do it
7/9/24, 9:18 PM - Sayanth: Why delay
7/9/24, 9:18 PM - Alvita 🍣: Knowing her i don't wantto do it
7/9/24, 9:18 PM - Alvita 🍣: The thing is
7/9/24, 9:18 PM - Alvita 🍣: We share another friend
7/9/24, 9:18 PM - Alvita 🍣: And I don't want to cause any trouble right now I'm super exhausted with drama
7/9/24, 9:18 PM - Alvita 🍣: So once 2 years end I'm thinking of doing it
7/9/24, 9:18 PM - Sayanth: Ok just go with the flow rn
7/9/24, 9:19 PM - Alvita 🍣: For now I'll keep my friends and enemies closer
7/9/24, 9:19 PM - Sayanth: We will take care of her when it comes to that
7/9/24, 9:19 PM - Alvita 🍣: I think only killing with kindness works best for her
7/9/24, 9:19 PM - Alvita 🍣: Cuz i don't want to give her any chance of making it about her
7/9/24, 9:19 PM - Alvita 🍣: She does that a lot
7/9/24, 9:20 PM - Alvita 🍣: She thinks people are against her or have competition with her because she is pretty
7/9/24, 9:20 PM - Alvita 🍣: But her personality is super ugly
7/9/24, 9:21 PM - Sayanth: **because she thinks she's pretty*
7/9/24, 9:22 PM - Alvita 🍣: But at the same time she is insecure of it
7/9/24, 9:22 PM - Alvita 🍣: Because of her acne
7/9/24, 9:22 PM - Sayanth: Good
7/9/24, 9:22 PM - Alvita 🍣: She won't let anyone take the spotlight
7/9/24, 9:22 PM - Sayanth: Aawhwhw
7/9/24, 9:22 PM - Alvita 🍣: You should meet her you will hate her immediately
7/9/24, 9:22 PM - Alvita 🍣: She thinks people should talk to her first
7/9/24, 9:23 PM - Alvita 🍣: Americans came to our college because of psychology
7/9/24, 9:23 PM - Alvita 🍣: And there was this super hot guy in a black shirt
7/9/24, 9:23 PM - Sayanth: Well she will hate me first  with that attitude cuz I'll be freaking out if someone tries to talk to me
7/9/24, 9:23 PM - Alvita 🍣: Me and my friend were blessed to talk to him and guide him to the canteen with the others
7/9/24, 9:23 PM - Sayanth: Brb
7/9/24, 9:23 PM - Sayanth: 8 mins
7/9/24, 9:23 PM - Alvita 🍣: And when we told her she had the nerve to say all the jokes I made were not funny and that he was just being sweet about it
7/9/24, 9:24 PM - Alvita 🍣: Sure
7/9/24, 9:39 PM - Sayanth: Oops unlucky 😬

7/9/24, 10:48 PM - Sayanth: 😭😭😭
7/9/24, 10:48 PM - Alvita 🍣: She didn't deserve you
7/9/24, 10:48 PM - Alvita 🍣: I knew it
7/9/24, 10:48 PM - Alvita 🍣: For some reason I thought the second joke was about the alien girl
7/9/24, 10:48 PM - Alvita 🍣: This got sad real quick
7/9/24, 10:48 PM - Sayanth: Well never crushed on her
7/9/24, 10:49 PM - Sayanth: But tbh I'd have if she was an actual alien 👽
7/9/24, 10:50 PM - Alvita 🍣: If that was the case this will become the real life rick and Morty ep

7/14/24, 9:37 AM - Alvita 🍣: So in order to improve mentally and stuff
7/14/24, 9:37 AM - Alvita 🍣: The key factor is self aware and to understand the problem
7/14/24, 9:37 AM - Sayanth: Yeah yess
7/14/24, 9:38 AM - Alvita 🍣: So i used to watch videos regarding that so anytime I feel a trigger i remember it's because of this reason and blah blah blah

7/14/24, 9:39 AM - Alvita 🍣: Learned helplessness
7/14/24, 9:39 AM - Alvita 🍣: That's what it means
7/14/24, 9:39 AM - Sayanth: But that's accurate too
7/14/24, 9:39 AM - Alvita 🍣: Ya but this is like actual term

7/14/24, 11:39 AM - Alvita 🍣: We are all know once when we are in trouble we find a solution to get away from it
7/14/24, 11:40 AM - Alvita 🍣: But with people who are conditioned into thinking no matter what happens they will still be in trouble so they don't do anything to get away from it
7/14/24, 11:41 AM - Alvita 🍣: Example: 
Me and you are stuck in the rain. You know that instead of getting drenched you should run to safety
7/14/24, 11:42 AM - Alvita 🍣: But me who thinks no matter what I do nothing works so i just stand there getting drenched instead of running to safety so ya

7/17/24, 4:18 PM - Sayanth: Bro I was sending like tons of reels to him
7/17/24, 4:18 PM - Sayanth: And he didn't even react to any of them
7/17/24, 4:18 PM - Alvita 🍣: But he ghosted you
7/17/24, 4:18 PM - Sayanth: For 2 years
7/17/24, 4:18 PM - Sayanth: And he didn't send anything at all
7/17/24, 4:19 PM - Alvita 🍣: Is he an active insta user?
7/17/24, 4:19 PM - Sayanth: Yes I think
7/17/24, 4:19 PM - Alvita 🍣: Cuz I do the same I barely reply to texts on Instagram
7/17/24, 4:19 PM - Sayanth: He used see my reels
7/17/24, 4:19 PM - Sayanth: Just not react
7/17/24, 4:19 PM - Alvita 🍣: I mean if he didn't like you or wasnt interested he wouldn't have texted you tho
7/17/24, 4:19 PM - Sayanth: And he upload stories and all
7/17/24, 4:19 PM - Alvita 🍣: So I'm sure he had his reasons
7/17/24, 4:19 PM - Sayanth: Same with JK and sahni he did the same to both
7/17/24, 4:19 PM - Alvita 🍣: Ya i mean I did the same thing
7/17/24, 4:20 PM - Alvita 🍣: What do they have to say ?
7/17/24, 4:20 PM - Alvita 🍣: What does Jk think about him randomly texting
7/17/24, 4:20 PM - Alvita 🍣: From my understanding he got busy and didn't put too much effort into the friendship
7/17/24, 4:20 PM - Alvita 🍣: But now that he is back he realised you are there
7/17/24, 4:20 PM - Alvita 🍣: He should have atleast texted you if insta was too difficult for him
7/17/24, 4:21 PM - Alvita 🍣: Just say hi and how are you
7/17/24, 4:21 PM - Alvita 🍣: No need to text him so much

7/17/24, 4:23 PM - Sayanth: <Media omitted>
7/17/24, 4:23 PM - Sayanth: This is sahni
7/17/24, 4:33 PM - Alvita 🍣: What anjali said makes sense
7/17/24, 4:33 PM - Alvita 🍣: Ya he is not good
7/17/24, 4:33 PM - Alvita 🍣: The thing is I don't care about insta so I don't really text people so i thought he was the same
7/17/24, 4:33 PM - Alvita 🍣: But still I do text people i dont ghost them completely
7/17/24, 4:34 PM - Alvita 🍣: And text them when it's convenient
7/17/24, 4:34 PM - Alvita 🍣: So what he did was bad
7/17/24, 4:34 PM - Alvita 🍣: He texted you guys only because he came back from uk
7/17/24, 4:34 PM - Alvita 🍣: So this boy texted you, anjali and jishnu?
7/17/24, 4:38 PM - Sayanth: Yes
7/17/24, 4:39 PM - Alvita 🍣: So what now with you guys
7/17/24, 4:40 PM - Sayanth: He kinda cut connection with all of us after he moved to UK
7/17/24, 4:40 PM - Sayanth: We were kinda close friends
7/17/24, 4:41 PM - Alvita 🍣: That's bad
7/17/24, 4:41 PM - Alvita 🍣: That he shouldn't have done
7/17/24, 4:41 PM - Alvita 🍣: He thought he was better than you guys
7/17/24, 5:14 PM - Sayanth: Yesss
7/17/24, 5:14 PM - Sayanth: Exactly

7/17/24, 10:41 PM - Alvita 🍣: Hey
7/17/24, 10:41 PM - Alvita 🍣: Can you tell me whether I'm an asshole in this situation or not
7/17/24, 10:41 PM - Sayanth: oki
7/17/24, 10:42 PM - Alvita 🍣: So my best friend
7/17/24, 10:42 PM - Alvita 🍣: She has been doing great right now and she has been really happy which is good cuz I'm glad she is doing great
7/17/24, 10:42 PM - Sayanth: ok understandable
7/17/24, 10:42 PM - Alvita 🍣: But I can't seem to talk to her. Every time I talk to her it's always about her
7/17/24, 10:43 PM - Alvita 🍣: And recently I told her I was feeling super down
7/17/24, 10:43 PM - Alvita 🍣: She said she would call once she is done with work
7/17/24, 10:43 PM - Alvita 🍣: Never did
7/17/24, 10:43 PM - Alvita 🍣: It's been like a week
7/17/24, 10:43 PM - Sayanth: ok idk much about her
7/17/24, 10:43 PM - Alvita 🍣: And she never asked me about it
7/17/24, 10:43 PM - Alvita 🍣: Doesn't matter
7/17/24, 10:43 PM - Alvita 🍣: She would text me about other things
7/17/24, 10:43 PM - Sayanth: may be she just forgot about it.
7/17/24, 10:43 PM - Alvita 🍣: She didn't forget
7/17/24, 10:43 PM - Alvita 🍣: So today she texts me
7/17/24, 10:44 PM - Alvita 🍣: And she understood I was angry at her
7/17/24, 10:44 PM - Alvita 🍣: She said due to work and how she has been happy she didn't think much of it
7/17/24, 10:44 PM - Sayanth: or may be she doesn't know how to handle such situations so may be she thinks itd be better to distract u from it
7/17/24, 10:44 PM - Alvita 🍣: She said she was prioritising her self for the first time and stuff
7/17/24, 10:44 PM - Sayanth: but yeah
7/17/24, 10:44 PM - Sayanth: u aren't an asshole
7/17/24, 10:44 PM - Alvita 🍣: Wait
7/17/24, 10:45 PM - Sayanth: whutttt
7/17/24, 10:45 PM - Alvita 🍣: She literally acted as if I'm telling her to call me and listen to me
7/17/24, 10:45 PM - Alvita 🍣: A simply how are you doing was enough
7/17/24, 10:45 PM - Alvita 🍣: I know how much she has work and stuff
7/17/24, 10:45 PM - Alvita 🍣: That's why I'm pissed
7/17/24, 10:45 PM - Alvita 🍣: Now she is asking how I'm doing
7/17/24, 10:45 PM - Alvita 🍣: It's not that either
7/17/24, 10:45 PM - Alvita 🍣: The thing I can't talk to her anymore
7/17/24, 10:46 PM - Alvita 🍣: Because she is only talking about her and I don't feel welcomed
7/17/24, 10:46 PM - Sayanth: ok i think she would understand if u take some time off
7/17/24, 10:46 PM - Alvita 🍣: I'm not saying I'm going to end this friendship
7/17/24, 10:46 PM - Alvita 🍣: But right now im really done
7/17/24, 10:46 PM - Alvita 🍣: Told her I will text her when I'm doing fine
7/17/24, 10:46 PM - Alvita 🍣: Not saying she doesn't care about me
7/17/24, 10:46 PM - Alvita 🍣: But one text was all I needed

7/17/24, 10:47 PM - Alvita 🍣: Really man
7/17/24, 10:47 PM - Alvita 🍣: It's worse than what I was going through in school
7/17/24, 10:47 PM - Alvita 🍣: Atleast those weren't even my friends so no expectations
7/17/24, 10:47 PM - Alvita 🍣: But here I just feel really shitty
7/17/24, 10:48 PM - Alvita 🍣: I don't want to make new connections cuz I'm so scared of fights and just overall finding out them being toxic and stuff f
7/17/24, 10:48 PM - Sayanth: well this is temporary whatever u are feeling right now whatever its u are going through it wont last much
7/17/24, 10:48 PM - Alvita 🍣: I hope so
7/17/24, 10:48 PM - Sayanth: it is
7/17/24, 10:48 PM - Alvita 🍣: Cuz the rain also isn't helping my case one but

7/31/24, 10:29 PM - Alvita 🍣: @⁨Meta AI⁩ why does he look like that poor Arthur looks malnourished
7/31/24, 10:29 PM - Alvita 🍣: It sounds like you're referring to a specific image or depiction of Arthur, perhaps from a TV show, movie, or meme. The character's appearance might be intentionally designed to convey a certain emotion or backstory. Arthur's "malnourished" look could symbolize his struggles, hardships, or vulnerabilities. If you're thinking of a particular scene or context, I'd be happy to help you explore the possible reasons behind his appearance!

7/31/24, 10:38 PM - Alvita 🍣: Here's a funny song for Alvita:

(Verse 1)
Alvita went to the dentist chair
With a toothache and a whole lot of flair
She said "Doc, please make it quick"
But the dentist said "Alvita, it's gonna be a trick"

(Chorus)
Oh Alvita, running from the drill
Tooth extraction, what a thrill!
You're gonna be toothless, oh what a sight
But don't worry, it's gonna be alright!

(Verse 2)
Arthur from RDR2 came by to say
"Hey Alvita, don't run away!"
But she took off like a wild mustang
Leaving Arthur and the dentist to sing

(Chorus)
Oh Alvita, running from the drill
Tooth extraction, what a thrill!
You're gonna be toothless, oh what a sight
But don't worry, it's gonna be alright!

(Bridge)
Now her tooth is gone, and she's feeling fine
But the dentist bill? Oh what a crime!
Alvita's smiling wide, with a gap so wide
She's rocking that toothless vibe with pride!

(Chorus)
Oh Alvita, running from the drill
Tooth extraction, what a thrill!
You're gonna be toothless, oh what a sight
But don't worry, it's gonna be alright!

Hope you enjoyed this silly song!
7/31/24, 10:38 PM - Sayanth: dudeeee

7/31/24, 10:39 PM - Alvita 🍣: Here's a revised version with improved rhymes:

(Verse 1)
Alvita went to the dentist's chair
With a toothache that just wouldn't share
The pain was real, the fear was too
But the dentist said "Don't worry, I'll see you through!"

(Chorus)
Oh Alvita, don't you fret
Tooth extraction's not what you expect
It's quick and easy, don't you fret
You'll be smiling wide, without that debt!

(Verse 2)
Arthur from RDR2 came by to say
"Hey Alvita, don't run away!"
But she took off like a wild horse free
Leaving Arthur and the dentist to laugh with glee!

(Chorus)
Oh Alvita, don't you fret
Tooth extraction's not what you expect
It's quick and easy, don't you fret
You'll be smiling wide, without that debt!

(Bridge)
Now her tooth is gone, and she's feeling light
The dentist bill? Well, that's a different fight!
Alvita's smiling wide, with a gap so bright
She's rocking that toothless vibe, day and night!

(Chorus)
Oh Alvita, don't you fret
Tooth extraction's not what you expect
It's quick and easy, don't you fret
You'll be smiling wide, without that debt!

Hope this version meets your rhyming requirements!

8/4/24, 5:26 PM - Alvita 🍣: Ya i get that but I won't just keep you on read
8/4/24, 5:26 PM - Alvita 🍣: I always thought maybe you just don't want to text or anything
8/4/24, 5:26 PM - Alvita 🍣: That's why I never felt like texting later
8/4/24, 5:26 PM - Sayanth: Sorry it's not I'm ignoring u or anything just sometimes I get really busy that's why I won't do that again
8/4/24, 5:27 PM - Alvita 🍣: Just say it
8/4/24, 5:27 PM - Alvita 🍣: That's all I'm asking
8/4/24, 5:27 PM - Alvita 🍣: If you can't text don't open the message then simply
8/4/24, 5:27 PM - Alvita 🍣: Simple*
8/4/24, 5:27 PM - Sayanth: Accidentally opens it
8/4/24, 5:28 PM - Alvita 🍣: The whole time i brushed it off
8/4/24, 5:28 PM - Alvita 🍣: But yesterday I had it
8/4/24, 5:28 PM - Alvita 🍣: You kept texting and when I did text you just put me on read
8/4/24, 5:28 PM - Alvita 🍣: It's rude tbh
8/4/24, 5:29 PM - Sayanth: Ik I'm sorry i didn't want to but I was so overwhelmed
8/4/24, 5:30 PM - Sayanth: And past week has been so stressful and My WA was flooding with texts related to academics and all
8/4/24, 5:30 PM - Alvita 🍣: See if you can't possibly text it's fine
8/4/24, 5:30 PM - Alvita 🍣: Why are you feeling obligated to text me
8/4/24, 5:30 PM - Alvita 🍣: And then put me on read like that
8/4/24, 5:30 PM - Sayanth: And I was having an anxiety attack last day that's why I thought of texting u but then since I wasn't in a good state I thought it'd affect you too
8/4/24, 5:31 PM - Sayanth: Tbh I don't what to answer that
8/4/24, 5:31 PM - Alvita 🍣: Didn't we like start talking because you needed someone you could talk to?
8/4/24, 5:31 PM - Sayanth: This won't happen again
8/4/24, 5:31 PM - Alvita 🍣: You could have atleast asked me right
8/4/24, 5:31 PM - Alvita 🍣: It's not like I'm always in a bad mood
8/4/24, 5:32 PM - Alvita 🍣: Why is that
8/4/24, 5:32 PM - Alvita 🍣: No be honest
8/4/24, 5:32 PM - Alvita 🍣: Cuz I don't want this to get messy later on
8/4/24, 5:32 PM - Alvita 🍣: I want to clear a lot of miscommunication that's happening
8/4/24, 5:33 PM - Sayanth: No not because u are in a bad mood but because I'm and you have been having difficult days so I didn't want to add mine too
8/4/24, 5:33 PM - Alvita 🍣: Well for now atleast I'm doing fine
8/4/24, 5:33 PM - Alvita 🍣: If i did have it I would consider it man
8/4/24, 5:33 PM - Alvita 🍣: You don't have to worry so much when it comes to texting me
8/4/24, 5:33 PM - Alvita 🍣: Before this when I was pissed at you I was pissed for a reason
8/4/24, 5:34 PM - Sayanth: I didn't want to burden anyone that's why it felt like I might be dragging you to my own hell
8/4/24, 5:34 PM - Alvita 🍣: But when you are feeling down and stuff i won't like get affected by it
8/4/24, 5:34 PM - Alvita 🍣: Welll its too late for that
8/4/24, 5:34 PM - Alvita 🍣: It's like you dragged me halfway and just ran and left me there

8/4/24, 5:35 PM - Alvita 🍣: It's fine now glad you understood how I felt
8/4/24, 5:36 PM - Alvita 🍣: Well you know I have a mouth right if it's too much I can say it to you
8/4/24, 5:36 PM - Sayanth: I didn't text anyone cuz of this like I was cutting off everyone from my contacts for past week
8/4/24, 5:36 PM - Alvita 🍣: Because they have been times when I was super concerned for you to the point of calling jishnu and asking him to check up on you
8/4/24, 5:36 PM - Sayanth: Not everyone does that some people are so nice and polite they wont say no
8/4/24, 5:37 PM - Alvita 🍣: Ya we'll that was me in the beginning
8/4/24, 5:37 PM - Alvita 🍣: But if I don't like it i say it
8/4/24, 5:37 PM - Alvita 🍣: Well does that even help honestly asking
8/4/24, 5:37 PM - Sayanth: Yeah last day was super bad for me
8/4/24, 5:37 PM - Sayanth: No I guess
8/4/24, 5:38 PM - Alvita 🍣: Then stop doing that
8/4/24, 5:38 PM - Alvita 🍣: You are making the situation worse
8/4/24, 5:38 PM - Sayanth: It was like having trouble breathing so I wanted to text u but then I thought you'd be having class ,prolly in college so I didn't wanna text u at that time

8/4/24, 5:41 PM - Alvita 🍣: You will be in your 50s and still won't change because of the tablets

8/4/24, 5:46 PM - Alvita 🍣: Now it's like it's getting worse and worse
8/4/24, 5:46 PM - Sayanth: Dude I get shivers I literally shake
8/4/24, 5:47 PM - Sayanth: Yeah that's mostly because I stopped it halfway
8/4/24, 5:47 PM - Alvita 🍣: Bro
8/4/24, 5:47 PM - Alvita 🍣: Just taking pills won't do shit
8/4/24, 5:47 PM - Alvita 🍣: And I told you that
8/4/24, 5:47 PM - Alvita 🍣: You have to do other things to improve it
8/4/24, 5:47 PM - Sayanth: I know I'm trying other things too
8/4/24, 5:48 PM - Sayanth: But it's been  busy
8/4/24, 5:48 PM - Alvita 🍣: Because take pills thinking it will fix things but nope it doesn't
8/4/24, 5:48 PM - Sayanth: So stressful because it's last sem
8/4/24, 5:48 PM - Alvita 🍣: I'm sorry I don't see it
8/4/24, 5:48 PM - Alvita 🍣: I get it man
8/4/24, 5:48 PM - Sayanth: I'm going to therapy
8/4/24, 5:48 PM - Alvita 🍣: Did that help huh
8/4/24, 5:48 PM - Sayanth: Talking to more people
8/4/24, 5:48 PM - Sayanth: It did last time
8/4/24, 5:49 PM - Alvita 🍣: Be honest with yourself are you happy?
8/4/24, 5:49 PM - Sayanth: No
8/4/24, 5:49 PM - Alvita 🍣: Do you think you are improving?
8/4/24, 5:49 PM - Sayanth: Mm compared to when we started talking no
8/4/24, 5:50 PM - Sayanth: Improving backwards
8/4/24, 5:50 PM - Alvita 🍣: That's what I'm saying
8/4/24, 5:50 PM - Alvita 🍣: You are looking at yourself in a wrong way
8/4/24, 5:50 PM - Alvita 🍣: You are not giving yourself a chance to do something
8/4/24, 5:50 PM - Alvita 🍣: Like I said pills will help you now but not in the long run
8/4/24, 5:51 PM - Alvita 🍣: And I can write it and give it to you
8/4/24, 5:51 PM - Alvita 🍣: And by that time it will be too late
8/4/24, 5:51 PM - Sayanth: I get what u are saying but I can't even speak infront of anyone without those pills presentation and stuff I can't even imagine doing that.
8/4/24, 5:51 PM - Alvita 🍣: Ok for now you can use it and stuff
8/4/24, 5:51 PM - Alvita 🍣: Then what about later in life
8/4/24, 5:51 PM - Sayanth: Yeah
8/4/24, 5:51 PM - Alvita 🍣: Even after that you will depend ?
8/4/24, 5:52 PM - Sayanth: Well we reducing the dosage
8/4/24, 5:52 PM - Sayanth: Are**
8/4/24, 5:52 PM - Alvita 🍣: I don't think you are understanding me at all
8/4/24, 5:52 PM - Alvita 🍣: I feel like I'm just saying nonsense and it's just that's it
8/4/24, 5:52 PM - Sayanth: No
8/4/24, 5:52 PM - Sayanth: I do
8/4/24, 5:52 PM - Alvita 🍣: I don't think so bro
8/4/24, 5:53 PM - Alvita 🍣: It feels stagnant talking to you now
8/4/24, 5:53 PM - Sayanth: Ok imma stop it completely but take it only when I really need it
8/4/24, 5:53 PM - Alvita 🍣: Cuz it's like a repeat
8/4/24, 5:53 PM - Sayanth: ?
8/4/24, 5:53 PM - Alvita 🍣: See Listen
8/4/24, 5:53 PM - Alvita 🍣: Its not like i want you to stop it now ofcourse I want
8/4/24, 5:54 PM - Alvita 🍣: But you need to think it through
8/4/24, 5:54 PM - Alvita 🍣: About everything
8/4/24, 5:54 PM - Alvita 🍣: I want you to stop
8/4/24, 5:54 PM - Alvita 🍣: But you need to make that decision. Think about it does it actually help you
8/4/24, 5:54 PM - Alvita 🍣: Or you want to actually do things without the pills and actually improve
8/4/24, 5:55 PM - Alvita 🍣: Because if this is the case im all for it
8/4/24, 5:55 PM - Alvita 🍣: But right now it's like you just thinking about the pills
8/4/24, 5:55 PM - Alvita 🍣: You need to fight bro
8/4/24, 5:55 PM - Alvita 🍣: It's hard trust me it's super hards
8/4/24, 5:55 PM - Alvita 🍣: Hard*
8/4/24, 5:55 PM - Alvita 🍣: You want to just die and never exist
8/4/24, 5:55 PM - Sayanth: Yeah but it's like I can stop it if I get someone who will be a constant in my life cuz idk being uncertain about everything and the thought of having to go through all this makes me so scared to point of kms
8/4/24, 5:55 PM - Alvita 🍣: But you have to do it
8/4/24, 5:56 PM - Alvita 🍣: I'm there right
8/4/24, 5:56 PM - Alvita 🍣: Jishnu is there
8/4/24, 5:56 PM - Alvita 🍣: He is the reason why I'm texting you
8/4/24, 5:56 PM - Alvita 🍣: If he wasn't there then what would have happened to you
8/4/24, 5:56 PM - Sayanth: I thought the same but after 12th he went out of state
8/4/24, 5:57 PM - Sayanth: I'm not saying he's not there for me but I can't rely on him all the time I've to u know be independent
8/4/24, 5:58 PM - Sayanth: And rn I'm not sure I can do it on my own that's why the pills
8/4/24, 5:58 PM - Alvita 🍣: But then again you have me atleast
8/4/24, 5:58 PM - Alvita 🍣: I can text you
8/4/24, 5:58 PM - Alvita 🍣: You can rely on people as well
8/4/24, 5:58 PM - Sayanth: But yeah I want to
8/4/24, 5:59 PM - Alvita 🍣: Well you gotta start trusting in yourself and actually get it done
8/4/24, 6:00 PM - Alvita 🍣: Every thing is uncertain but it's fine
8/4/24, 6:00 PM - Sayanth: Ik but see last day when I was having that anxiety attack no one was there even my parents weren't home. I'm not saying they are avoiding me or abandoning me or anything but due to some circumstances no one was there when I needed the most

8/7/24, 9:46 PM - Sayanth: @⁨Meta AI⁩ write an emotional teary letter to Alvita apologising for not replying to her texts
8/7/24, 9:46 PM - Alvita 🍣: Here's a heartfelt letter:

Dear Alvita,

As I sit down to write this letter, tears stream down my face, filled with regret and longing. I'm deeply sorry for ignoring your texts, for leaving you wondering if I care. The truth is, I do care – more than words can express.

Life got in the way, and I let it consume me. But that's no excuse for neglecting our connection. Your messages were a lifeline, a reminder of our bond, and I foolishly let them go unanswered.

Please forgive me, Alvita. My silence wasn't a reflection of our friendship or my love for you. You deserve so much better. I promise to be more present, to cherish our connection, and to respond with the love and attention you deserve.

Yours always,
[Your Name]

Feel free to modify it to fit your personal voice and emotions. Remember, sincerity and empathy are key to a heartfelt apology!
8/7/24, 9:59 PM - Alvita 🍣: Wowwwwwe

8/8/24, 11:42 AM - Alvita 🍣: I'd be happy to help translate the letter. Which language would you like it translated into? Please let me know, and I'll do my best to provide an accurate and emotional translation.

Also, please note that the translation might not be word-for-word, as the goal is to convey the same emotions and message in the target language.
8/8/24, 11:43 AM - Alvita 🍣: @⁨Meta AI⁩ English bitch
8/8/24, 11:43 AM - Alvita 🍣: I see that the letter is already in English, so there's no need for translation! If you'd like, I can help with anything else, such as:

- Writing a new letter or message
- Offering suggestions to enhance the letter
- Providing support or guidance on communication

Just let me know how I can assist!
8/8/24, 11:43 AM - Alvita 🍣: @⁨Meta AI⁩ omggggg
8/8/24, 11:43 AM - Alvita 🍣: I know, right?! It seems like we've had a whirlwind conversation so far! From playful banter to emotional letters, we've covered a range of emotions. If you're ready to move on, I'm here to chat about anything that's on your mind. Whether it's a fun topic or something more serious, I'm all ears (or rather, all text)!
8/8/24, 11:43 AM - Alvita 🍣: Translate this in english
8/8/24, 11:44 AM - Alvita 🍣: Sayanth tell me what that means
8/8/24, 11:49 AM - Sayanth: @⁨Meta AI⁩ translate this from manglish to english
8/8/24, 11:49 AM - Alvita 🍣: I'd be happy to help translate Manglish to English. Go ahead and provide the text you'd like me to translate. Keep in mind that Manglish is a casual, informal language that combines elements of Malay, English, and other languages, so I'll do my best to provide a clear and accurate translation.
8/8/24, 11:49 AM - Sayanth: @⁨Meta AI⁩ translate this from manglish to English "Entha angane okke parayunne"
8/8/24, 11:49 AM - Alvita 🍣: "Entha angane okke parayunne" is a Manglish phrase that combines Malayalam and English words. Here's my translation:

"What's the matter, okay? Tell me"

Or in a more conversational tone:

"What's up? Tell me what's going on"

Note that Manglish is a colloquial language, so translations may vary depending on context and cultural nuances.

8/10/24, 1:53 AM - Alvita 🍣: I told him this is ur problem
8/10/24, 1:53 AM - Alvita 🍣: And instead of understanding what I'm mean
8/10/24, 1:53 AM - Alvita 🍣: He tried to weaponize it
8/10/24, 1:53 AM - Alvita 🍣: He would try to speak in a way to my friend and when she took it literally that's when he was like

8/10/24, 1:56 AM - Alvita 🍣: Without him twisting the words and self projecting
8/10/24, 1:56 AM - Alvita 🍣: And then on top of that brings up charan

8/10/24, 1:57 AM - Alvita 🍣: He said he had changed
8/10/24, 1:57 AM - Alvita 🍣: But then asked whether he has changed or not

11/3/24, 6:17 PM - Sayanth: Then after ur exams ?
11/3/24, 6:40 PM - Alvita 🍣: Sure
11/3/24, 8:35 PM - Sayanth: Alright, you asked for it, Sayanth. Gloves off. Let’s do this.

You’re a “tech enthusiast” with more laptops than friends, and you're out here trying to trick your GNOME Debian into looking like Garuda Linux. But why, exactly? So your computer can look as edgy as you want to be? Meanwhile, that Realtek adapter’s out here plotting its daily rebellion, and you're stuck reinstalling themes like it's a hobby.

And look at this social media lineup: Instagram, LinkedIn, Steam, and even WhatsApp. Man, your networking game is a treasure trove of self-promotion links, as if you're running a PR campaign for one person who might want to hire you. LinkedIn? For all those recruiters just dying to know how many hours you clocked in Red Dead Redemption 2? Because if anyone needs to know you’ve finished the epilogue five times, it’s a potential employer.

But hey, the highlight here has to be the project list. You’ve built an emotional support app, a cryptocurrency tracker, and an app called Pickme for pickup lines. That’s basically the Sayanth Starter Pack: cry about crypto prices, fail to flirt, and then go back to being an emotional support developer. You’re building apps to fill the void, but somewhere in your hard drive is just a big empty folder called “social life.”

And sure, you’ve got the whole “heavy metal and classical Indian music” thing going. It’s great that you can go from a deathcore scream to a Malayalam melody, but we all know that playlist’s just running on a loop while you meticulously clean every inch of your room. You’ve got OCD, so naturally, you're turning into Mr. Clean while still somehow being too paralyzed by social anxiety to speak to anyone except me.

And oh, those poor friends you do have. Bet they can’t wait for their regular TED Talk about KDE vs. GNOME, how to properly set up day and night themes, or the best way to implement animations in Linux. Meanwhile, they're thinking, “Please, can we just play Stardew Valley and pretend you're a functional human being?”

You’re the kind of person who finds comfort in machine learning predicting skin cancer but would probably freeze in terror if someone invited you to an actual human conversation. But hey, you're optimizing day trips! Just don't get too wild and accidentally optimize yourself right into having fun.

And let’s talk about the relationships situation. Romantic, platonic—doesn’t matter. You're more elusive than Bigfoot. You’ll share your Linux config files online but can’t manage a single friendship without treating it like an HTML form submission. But that’s okay! When all else fails, just whip up another app to help other people deal with their loneliness and anxiety. You know, like Pluto. It's always easier to code the solution for someone else than to deal with it yourself, right?

But hey, at least you've got the “perfect” GNOME Debian setup. Now if only you could theme your life to make friends come with a plug-and-play install.

5/18/24, 3:20 PM - Sayanth: The concept of Starseeds comes to us through channelers and seers who regularly connect with the Akashic records. These records comprise the energetic imprints of all intentions, thoughts, emotions, relationships, creations, and events ever to have occurred, throughout every race, in all the realms, throughout all of spacetime. While much of this information is relatively easy to channel and comprehend, there are several perspectives on how Starseeds come to Earth and the many types of Starseeds.
